## Summary
text
### <b><font color="red">Overview and Epidemiology of Stroke</font></b>

* **Stroke Definition**: A clinical diagnosis characterized by the <b>sudden onset of focal neurologic deficit</b> due to an underlying vascular pathology.
* **Stroke Clinical Features**: Symptoms typically include unilateral weakness (face, arm, leg), numbness, blindness in one eye, slurring of speech, dizziness, loss of balance, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
* **Stroke Age Categorization**: 
    1) <b>Hyperacute</b>: 0–6 hours.
    2) <b>Acute</b>: 6 hours – 3 days.
    3) <b>Subacute</b>: 3 days – 3 weeks.
    4) <b>Chronic</b>: > 3 weeks.
* **Stroke Mimickers**: Conditions that can present like stroke include seizures (Todd’s paralysis), systemic infection, brain tumor, toxic-metabolic issues, positional vertigo, cardiac events, syncope, trauma, subdural hematoma, and herpes encephalitis.
* **Todd’s Paralysis**: A transient weakness occurring after a seizure, specifically after status epilepticus (>5 minutes).
* **Stroke Epidemiology**: A major cause of death and disability; in the Philippines, mortality is <b>82.8/100,000</b> and morbidity accounts for 81% of Daily-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
* **Non-Modifiable Risk Factors**: Increasing age, male sex, and genetics.
* **Modifiable Risk Factors**: Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac causes, CNS infections (e.g., TB), dyslipidemia, snoring, smoking, and physical inactivity.

### <b><font color="red">Ischemic Stroke: Mechanisms and Pathophysiology</font></b>

* **Ischemic Stroke Core Feature**: <b>Thrombosis</b>, often involving Virchow’s triad: blood stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury.
* **Ischemic Stroke (Thrombus Formation)**: Endothelial injury exposes vWF → platelet GP Ib binding → platelet activation/aggregation via fibrinogen → fibrin stabilization → RBC entrapment.
* **Ischemic Stroke (White vs. Red Clot)**: Platelet-rich clots are <b>white clots</b>; RBC-rich clots are <b>red clots</b>.
* **Ischemic Stroke (Three Main Mechanisms)**: 1) Atherosclerosis & Thrombosis, 2) Cardioembolism, 3) Small Vessel Disease.
* **Atherothrombosis (Atherosclerosis Pathogenesis)**: LDL oxidation attracts macrophages → Foam cells form in the intima → <b>Atherosclerotic plaque</b> with a thin fibrous cap forms → Luminal narrowing (stenosis).
* **Atherothrombosis (Clinical Features)**: Often related to <b>recurrent TIA</b> and an intermittent <b>"stuttering" progression</b> of neurologic deficits.
* **Atherothrombosis (Ethnic Distribution)**: <b>Extracranial</b> lesions are common in Caucasians; <b>Intracranial</b> lesions are common in Asians.
* **Atherothrombosis (Common Sites)**: Plaque commonly forms at bifurcations (due to non-laminar flow and shear stress), specifically the <b>Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)</b>, vertebral arteries, and proximal segments of the MCA, ACA, and PCA.
* **Cardioembolism (Etiology)**: The most common risk is <b>chronic atrial fibrillation (AF)</b>; the highest risk is <b>valvular heart disease</b>.
* **Cardioembolism (Clinical Features)**: <b>Sudden onset</b> with neurologic deficit at its <b>peak</b>; no stuttering progression.
* **Cardioembolism (Hemodynamic Pathophysiology)**: AF causes atrial-ventricular dissociation → blood stasis → <b>Red clot</b> formation (typically in the <b>left atrial appendage</b>).
* **Cardioembolism (Hemorrhagic Conversion)**: Cardioembolic strokes have a high risk of <b>hemorrhagic infarction</b> (hemorrhagic conversion on CT) because red clots are friable and prone to lysis.
* **Small Vessel Disease (Lacunar Stroke)**: Obstruction of a single small penetrating arteriole (e.g., lenticulostriate or pontine perforating arteries) supplying deep brain structures; infarct size is <b>< 15 mm</b>.
* **Small Vessel Disease (Pathology)**: Primarily caused by <b>Lipohyalinosis</b> (wall thickening due to fibrinoid material accumulation related to hypertension).
* **Ischemic Stroke (Ischemic Zones)**:
    1) <b>Infarct Core</b>: Irreversible ischemia; blood flow < 12 mL/100g/min.
    2) <b>Penumbra</b>: Reversibly ischemic, vulnerable tissue; the target of reperfusion therapy.
    3) <b>Oligemia</b>: Reduced flow (22–35 mL/100g/min) with collateral support; transient dysfunction only.

### <b><font color="red">Management of Ischemic Stroke</font></b>

* **Stroke Diagnostics (CT Scan)**: Non-contrast CT is the first-line to <b>rule out hemorrhage</b>; it has <b>low sensitivity</b> for ischemia in the hyperacute stage (< 6 hours).
* **Stroke Diagnostics (MRI)**: High sensitivity for early ischemia; <b>DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging)</b> detects restricted water movement (cytotoxic edema) as a bright/hyperintense signal, confirmed by a low <b>ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient)</b>.
* **Intravenous Thrombolysis**: Administration of <b>rTPA</b> for candidates with stroke onset <b>< 4.5 hours</b>.
* **Endovascular Treatment**: Includes <b>Intra-arterial thrombolysis</b> (< 4.5 hours) and <b>Mechanical Thrombectomy</b> (onset <b>< 18 hours</b>).
* **The "5H's" of Acute Stroke Care**: Manage Hypoxia, Hypovolemia, Hyper/Hypotension, Hyper/Hypothermia, and metabolic derangements (Hypo/Hypernatremia or glycemia).
* **Permissive Hypertension**: In ischemic stroke, allow elevated BP to maintain cerebral perfusion; avoid treatment unless SBP <b>> 220</b>, DBP <b>> 120</b>, or MAP <b>> 130</b>.
* **Hypertension Treatment Exceptions**: Lower BP immediately if the patient has <b>hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, or AMI</b> ("heart over brain").
* **Secondary Prevention (Atherothrombotic/SVD)**: Use <b>Antiplatelet agents</b> (Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Cilostazol, Dipyridamole, or Triflusal).
* **Secondary Prevention (Cardioembolic)**: Use <b>Anticoagulants</b> (Warfarin or NOACs/DOACs like Dabigatran, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban).
* **Statins in Stroke**: Used for their <b>pleiotropic effect</b> (plaque stabilization) rather than just lipid lowering.
* **Neuroprotection**: Includes <b>Citicoline</b> (membrane stabilization), <b>Edaravone</b> (oxidative stress reduction), and <b>Cerebrolysin</b> (neurotrophic factors).

### <b><font color="red">Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)</font></b>

* **TIA Definition**: Transient focal neurologic deficit <b>without</b> evidence of infarction on neuroimaging, typically lasting <b>< 1 hour</b>.
* **TIA Clinical Significance**: Single attacks suggest embolic phenomena; recurrent attacks suggest vascular occlusion. High risk if recurrent, involving unilateral weakness, or lasting > 1 hour.
* **ABCD² Score for TIA**: Used to predict the 2-day stroke risk:
    - <b>0–3 (Low)</b>: 1% risk; outpatient possible.
    - <b>4–5 (Medium)</b>: 4.1% risk; admission warranted.
    - <b>6–7 (High)</b>: 8.1% risk; urgent admission essential.

### <b><font color="red">Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)</font></b>

* **ICH Definition**: Extravasation of blood into the brain parenchyma due to a ruptured arteriole; presents with sudden deficit, headache, nausea, and rapid sensorium deterioration.
* **ICH Epidemiology**: Incidence is higher in <b>Asians</b> (linked to high salt diet). Mortality and disability are higher than in ischemic stroke.
* **ICH Risk Factors**: <b>Hypertension</b> is the most important independent risk factor. Others include low LDL/TG, excessive alcohol, and sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., <b>Phenylpropanolamine</b> in decongestants).
* **ICH Pathology**: <b>Lipohyalinosis</b> leads to <b>Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms</b> (micro-aneurysms) that rupture.
* **ICH Common Sites**: 
    1) <b>Basal Ganglia (Putamen)</b>: 40–50% (Most common).
    2) Lobar areas (20–40%).
    3) Thalamus (10–15%).
    4) Pons (5–12%).
* **ICH Diagnostics (CT Scan)**: Appears as <b>hyperdensity</b> in the hyperacute stage.
* **ICH Spot Sign**: Focal enhancement within the bleed on CT, indicating <b>active bleeding</b> and a high risk of hematoma expansion.
* **ICH Treatment**: Target <b>SBP < 140 mmHg</b> (INTERACT trial) to reduce expansion risk. 
* **ICH Decompression**: Medical (Mannitol, Hypertonic Saline) or Surgical (Early evacuation or Hemicraniectomy for deep bleeds).

### <b><font color="red">Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)</font></b>

* **SAH Types**: 1) <b>Traumatic</b> (most common overall), 2) <b>Non-traumatic</b> (most common cause is a <b>ruptured aneurysm</b>).
* **SAH Clinical Manifestation**: <b>"Worst headache of life"</b> or <b>"Thunderclap headache"</b>; associated with photophobia, stiff neck (nuchal rigidity), and seizures.
* **Non-traumatic SAH Pathology**: Apoptosis of smooth muscle and <b>degeneration of the internal elastic lamina</b> weaken the arterial wall.
* **Aneurysm Types**: 1) <b>Saccular</b> (outpouching on one side), 2) <b>Fusiform</b> (circumferential enlargement of a segment).
* **Aneurysm Locations**: 
    - <b>ACA & ACom bifurcation</b>: 40% (Most common).
    - MCA bifurcation: 34%.
    - MCA & PCom bifurcation: 20%.
* **PCom Aneurysm Sign**: Compression of <b>Cranial Nerve III</b> leads to a pupil-involving oculomotor nerve palsy.
* **SAH Diagnostics (CT Sensitivity)**: 98–100% within 12 hours; drops to 57–85% by day 6.
* **SAH Diagnostics (Lumbar Puncture)**: Performed if CT is negative but suspicion is high. Findings include <b>Xanthochromia</b> (yellowish CSF from bilirubin).
* **Traumatic Tap vs. True SAH**: In a traumatic tap, RBC count decreases from the first to the last vial; in true SAH, RBC count remains constant across vials.
* **SAH Gold Standard Diagnostic**: <b>Digital Subtraction Cerebral Angiography</b>; if negative, repeat in 7–14 days after the clot lyses.
* **SAH Grading (Hunt and Hess Scale)**: Grades 1–2 are "good"; Grades 3–5 (drowsiness to coma) are "poor."
* **SAH Complications (Re-rupture)**: Risk is 4% in the first 24 hours, then 1% daily. <b>Severe</b> disability/mortality if it occurs.
* **SAH Complications (Vasospasm)**: Narrowing of vessels due to blood irritation; occurs within the <b>first 21 days</b>.
* **SAH Complications (Hydrocephalus)**: CSF reabsorption is blocked by blood products in the subarachnoid space.
* **SAH Management**: Bed rest, pain control, target <b>SBP < 150 mmHg</b> (unsecured), and <b>Nimodipine (60mg QID x 21 days)</b> to prevent vasospasm.
* **SAH Definitive Treatment**: <b>Clipping</b> (surgical) or <b>Endovascular Coiling</b>.

### <b><font color="red">Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Herniation</font></b>

* **Monroe-Kellie Doctrine**: The skull is fixed; volume = Brain (80%) + Blood (10%) + CSF (10%). If one increases, another must decrease to keep ICP <b>0–20 mmHg</b>.
* **Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**: CBF = MAP – ICP. Autoregulation maintains this.
* **Increased ICP Features**: Headache, nausea/vomiting, papilledema, and decreased sensorium.
* **Cushing’s Triad (Sign of ↑ ICP)**: 1) Bradycardia, 2) Increased pulse pressure, 3) Increased MAP.
* **Brain Herniation Types**:
    1) <b>Subfalcine</b>: Cingulate gyrus under falx cerebri.
    2) <b>Uncal</b>: Temporal uncus through tentorial notch; compresses CN III.
    3) <b>Central</b>: Diencephalon/midbrain downward; leads to coma.
    4) <b>Tonsillar</b>: Cerebellar tonsils through foramen magnum; medulla compression risk.
* **Kernohan Phenomenon**: Uncal herniation compresses the contralateral cerebral peduncle, causing <b>ipsilateral</b> motor weakness (a false localizing sign) and ipsilateral CN III palsy.
* **Decorticate Posturing**: Arms flexed, legs extended; lesion is <b>above</b> the red nucleus (cortex/internal capsule).
* **Decerebrate Posturing**: All limbs extended; lesion is <b>at/below</b> the red nucleus (brainstem).
* **Respiratory Patterns in ↑ ICP**:
    - <b>Cheyne-Stokes</b>: Gradually deep/shallow with apnea.
    - <b>Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation</b>: Fast, deep, regular breaths.
    - <b>Ataxic</b>: Completely irregular/erratic (no coordination).
* **ICP Emergency Management**:
    1) Head elevation <b>15–30 degrees</b> (midline) to enhance venous outflow.
    2) **Hyperventilation** (PaCO2 26–30 mmHg) for temporary vasoconstriction.
    3) **Mannitol** or Hypertonic Saline.
    4) Avoid hypotonic fluids.

### <b><font color="red">Fundamentals of Memory and Cognitive Reserve</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Memory</font></b> can be divided based on duration and nature: **Long-Term Memory** (>1 min) is either **Explicit** (Declarative) or **Implicit** (Non-declarative).
* <b><font color="red">Explicit Memory</font></b> (Declarative) includes **Episodic Memory** (autobiographic data managed by mesiotemporal regions) and **Semantic Memory** (encyclopedic knowledge regulated by temporal and parietal regions).
* <b><font color="red">Implicit Memory</font></b> is demonstrated through tasks that do not require conscious processes, such as **Procedural Memory** (motor skills/cognitive routines) and **Priming**.
* <b><font color="red">Short-Term Memory</font></b> (Working Memory) typically lasts 30-40 seconds and involves the **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)** and associative visual/auditory areas.
* <b><font color="red">Dementia</font></b> is defined as an **acquired, persistent impairment** of intellectual function involving multiple spheres (Attention, Executive, Memory, Language, etc.) sufficient to **interfere with daily functioning**.
* <b><font color="red">Theory of Cognitive Reserve</font></b> suggests that individuals with higher mental stimulation (education, occupation) can tolerate greater brain pathology before showing symptoms; thus, **lower educational background** is a risk factor for dementia.

### <b><font color="red">Epidemiology and Classification of Dementia</font></b>

* The most common causes of <b><font color="red">Dementing Disease</font></b> in order of frequency are: 1) **Cerebral Atrophy** (Alzheimer's), 2) **Multi-infarct (Vascular) Dementia**, and 3) **Alcoholic Dementia**.
* <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</font></b> is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, accounting for 43% to 70% of cases.
* <b><font color="red">Classification of Dementia</font></b> based on associated signs:
    | Category | Examples |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Progressive (No other signs)** | Alzheimer's, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) |
    | **Progressive (With Neuro signs)** | Huntington's (Chorea), Lewy Body (Parkinsonism), ALS complex |
    | **Cortical Dementias** | Alzheimer's, FTD, Lewy Body Dementia |
    | **Subcortical Dementias** | Parkinson Disease Dementia, Huntington's, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy |

### <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Clinical Profile</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</font></b> is characterized by a **gradual, progressive (insidious) decline** in cognitive function and activities of daily living.
* <b><font color="red">Ribot’s Law</font></b> in **Alzheimer's** states that memories of the **distant past are relatively preserved** while recent information is lost first.
* <b><font color="red">Atypical Features</font></b> that may suggest a diagnosis other than **Alzheimer’s** include early incontinence, early gait problems, movement disorders, or gaze problems.
* <b><font color="red">NINCDS-ADRDA Criteria</font></b> for **Alzheimer's** includes: Age >40, deficits in 2+ cognitive areas with worsening, absence of disturbed consciousness, and clinical examination confirmation.
* <b><font color="red">Bedside Memory Tests</font></b> used to screen for cognitive impairment in the Philippines include the **MMSE** (Mini-Mental State Exam) and the more sensitive **MOCA** (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

### <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Biomarkers and Genetics</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Spectrum of AD</font></b> progression:
    1. **Pre-clinical**: Changes in biomarkers (amyloid) begin without symptoms.
    2. **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**: Noticeable memory changes **but No impairment in activities of daily living**.
    3. **Dementia due to AD**: Symptoms impair functional daily life.
* <b><font color="red">Biomarkers of Amyloid accumulation</font></b> in **AD** include abnormal tracer retention on PET scans and **Low CSF amyloid (Aβ42)**.
* <b><font color="red">Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration</font></b> in **AD** include **Elevated CSF Tau** (total and phosphorylated), decreased FDG uptake on PET, and hippocampal/cortical atrophy on MRI.
* <b><font color="red">Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)</font></b> genetics: The **E4 variant (Chromosome 19)** is linked to late-onset <b>AD</b>, while the **E2 variant is protective**.

### <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Pathology and Severe Signs</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Gross MRI findings</font></b> in **AD** typically show **medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy** with enlarged ventricles and thin gyri.
* <b><font color="red">Neuronal loss</font></b> in early **AD** occurs significantly in the **entorhinal cortex (Layer II)** (leading to changes in smell) and the **Nucleus Basalis of Meynert** (the source of Acetylcholine).
* <b><font color="red">Neuropathological Findings</font></b> in **AD** consist of three hallmarks:
    1. **Neurofibrillary tangles**: Intracellular hyperphosphorylated **Tau**.
    2. **Neuritic (Amyloid) plaques**: Extracellular **Amyloid-β** deposits.
    3. **Granulovacuolar degeneration**: At the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus.
* <b><font color="red">Severe Alzheimer's Disease</font></b> symptoms include **Sundowning** (evening restlessness), nighttime confusion, and **Frontal Release Signs** (primitive reflexes like grasp, snout, and palmomental).

### <b><font color="red">Frontotemporal and Lewy Body Dementias</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)</font></b> (Pick's Disease) is associated with **Lobar Atrophy**, **Primary Progressive Aphasia** (effortful speech), and **Semantic Dementia** (impaired word comprehension).
* <b><font color="red">FTD Pathology</font></b> involves **Argentophilic (Pick) bodies** in the temporal lobes and **Chromosome 17** abnormalities leading to increased Tau deposits.
* <b><font color="red">Lewy Body Dementia (LBD)</font></b> is characterized by early-onset dementia accompanied by **Visual Hallucinations**, **Parkinsonism**, and **Fluctuating attention**.
* <b><font color="red">REM Movement Disorder</font></b> (acting out dreams) is a suggestive symptom of <b><font color="red">Lewy Body Dementia</font></b> or Parkinson's Disease.

### <b><font color="red">Subcortical and Vascular Dementias</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Parkinson Disease Dementia (PDD)</font></b> is diagnosed when cognitive deficits severe enough to impact daily life develop **at least 1 year after** the onset of Parkinsonism.
* <b><font color="red">Huntington’s Disease</font></b> is an **Autosomal Dominant** (complete penetrance) disorder on **Chr 4** characterized by **Choreoathetosis**, progressive dementia, and **39-50 CAG repeats**.
* <b><font color="red">Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)</font></b> presents with an **early onset of falls**, **Vertical gaze difficulties**, and "slurring/choking" bulbar problems.
* <b><font color="red">PSP Imaging</font></b> hallmarks on MRI include **"Mouse ears"** (dorsal mesencephalon atrophy) and the **"Hummingbird/Penguin sign"** (midbrain atrophy with preserved pons).
* <b><font color="red">Vascular Dementia</font></b> is characterized by **focal neurologic signs** and a **stepwise progression** (sudden declines with every new stroke) rather than a slow, insidious decline.

### <b><font color="red">Rapidly Progressing and Reversible Dementias</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD)</font></b> is a rapidly progressive prion disease (mean survival 5 months) showing **Myoclonus**, **EEG Periodic sharp waves**, and **CSF 14-3-3 protein**.
* <b><font color="red">Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)</font></b> (Mad Cow) affects a wider age range, starts with **found psychiatric illness**, and shows the **Pulvinar sign** on MRI.
* <b><font color="red">Korsakoff Amnestic Syndrome</font></b> is associated with thiamine (B1) deficiency and chronic alcoholism, presenting with **Confabulation** (honest lying) and severe anterograde/retrograde amnesia (though never complete).
* <b><font color="red">Reversible/Curable Dementias</font></b> should be ruled out first and include **Vitamin B12 deficiency**, **Hypothyroidism**, and **Hepatic encephalopathy**.

### <b><font color="red">Pharmacotherapy and Symptomatic Management</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Cholinesterase Inhibitors</font></b> used to treat **Alzheimer's** include:
    1. **Donepezil**: Long-acting, selective inhibitor of AChE.
    2. **Rivastigmine**: Intermediate-acting, inhibits both AChE and BuChE; available in **transdermal patch**.
    3. **Galantamine**: Dual mechanism but rarely used now due to cardiotoxicity (bradycardia/heart block).
* <b><font color="red">Memantine</font></b> is an **uncompetitive NMDA antagonist** that treats **Alzheimer's** by reducing the toxic effects of excess glutamate (Excitotoxicity).
* <b><font color="red">Antipsychotics</font></b> (like high-dose agents) are **Not recommended** for dementia-related agitation due to increased **cardiovascular mortality** in the elderly; low-dose **Risperidone** is the preferred agent if necessary.
* <b><font color="red">Agitation and Aggression</font></b> in dementia, specifically FTD, are treated with **SSRIs or SNRIs** as first-line therapy.

### <b><font color="red">Comparative Differentiating Features</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Alzheimer’s vs. Vascular Dementia</font></b>: <b>AD</b> has an **insidious, slow onset**, while **Vascular Dementia** follows a **stepwise progression** linked to stroke events.
* <b><font color="red">Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) vs. Parkinson Disease Dementia (PDD)</font></b>: In **LBD**, dementia occurs **before or within 1 year** of parkinsonism; in **PDD**, dementia occurs **more than 1 year after** parkinsonism has been established.
* <b><font color="red">Cortical vs. Subcortical Dementia</font></b>: **Cortical** (AD, FTD) primarily affects memory and language; **Subcortical** (PDD, Huntington’s, PSP) involves motor signs like chorea, rigidity, or gaze palsies earlier in the course.
* <b><font color="red">sCJD vs. vCJD MRI</font></b>: **sCJD** often shows "cortical ribboning," while **vCJD** is specifically identified by the **Pulvinar sign**.
* <b><font color="red">Donepezil vs. Rivastigmine</font></b>: **Donepezil** is purely an AChE inhibitor, whereas **Rivastigmine** inhibits both AChE and BuChE and offers a **transdermal patch** option for patients who forget oral meds.
* <b><font color="red">ApoE E4 vs. ApoE E2</font></b>: **E4** increases the risk and lowers the age of onset for **AD**, while **E2** is the **protective** variant.
* <b><font color="red">Pick’s Disease (FTD) vs. Alzheimer's</font></b>: **Pick's** focuses on early **behavioral/language** changes and lobar atrophy, whereas **AD** primarily starts with **short-term memory** loss and hippocampal atrophy.
* <b><font color="red">Huntington's vs. PSP</font></b>: **Huntington's** is defined by **Chorea** and genetic CAG repeats, while **PSP** is defined by **Vertical gaze palsy** and early falls.
* <b><font color="red">Decorticate vs. Decerebrate Posturing</font></b>: **Decorticate** (arms flexed) indicates a lesion **above the red nucleus**; **Decerebrate** (all limbs extended) indicates a lesion **at or below the red nucleus** and carries a worse prognosis.
* <b><font color="red">MMSE vs. MOCA</font></b>: **MMSE** is a basic 30-point screen; **MOCA** is also 30 points but is **more sensitive and specific** for detecting milder forms of cognitive impairment.
* <b><font color="red">Episodic vs. Semantic Memory</font></b>: **Episodic** is "what you did" (autobiographical); **Semantic** is "what things are" (encyclopedic knowledge).

### <b><font color="red">Neuroimaging: Noninvasive Modalities</font></b>

| Modality | Key Indications | Unique/Hallmark Findings | Advantages/Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b><font color="red">Skull X-ray</font></b> | Trauma (infants), calcifications, bony erosions. | <b><font color="red">Ping-pong fractures</font></b>: benign depressed fractures in infants; <b><font color="red">Comminuted fractures</font></b>. | <b><font color="red">Disadvantage</font></b>: Largely replaced by CT; only shows bone/sutures. |
| <b><font color="red">Cranial Ultrasound (CUS)</font></b> | Neonates (open fontanelles) and adults post-craniectomy. | Detects <b><font color="red">neonatal hemorrhage</font></b>, hydrocephalus, and hypoxic-ischemic events. | <b><font color="red">Advantage</font></b>: Cheap, bedside, real-time, no radiation. <b><font color="red">Disadvantage</font></b>: Cannot see posterior fossa; user-dependent. |
| <b><font color="red">Computed Tomography (CT)</font></b> | <b><font color="red">Trauma (imaging of choice)</font></b>, acute stroke, herniation. | <b><font color="red">Hyperdense</font></b> (acute blood) vs <b><font color="red">Hypodense</font></b> (chronic blood). | <b><font color="red">Advantage</font></b>: Fast (5 mins), safe with metal. <b><font color="red">Disadvantage</font></b>: Radiation exposure. |
| <b><font color="red">MRI</font></b> | <b><font color="red">White matter/demyelinating diseases</font></b>, spinal cord tumors, seizures. | Superior <b><font color="red">gray-white matter differentiation</font></b>. | <b><font color="red">Advantage</font></b>: No radiation, nonionizing. <b><font color="red">Disadvantage</font></b>: Slow (30-60 mins), expensive, dangerous with metal/ferromagnetic objects. |
| <b><font color="red">MRA</font></b> | Vascular malformations, aneurysms, chronic headache. | Visualizes the <b><font color="red">Circle of Willis</font></b> and great branches noninvasively. | <b><font color="red">Disadvantage</font></b>: Cannot see small tributaries (requires angiography). |
| <b><font color="red">PET Scan</font></b> | Dementia (alpha-synuclein), secondary brain malignancies. | Measures <b><font color="red">metabolic activity</font></b> using radioactive glucose tracer. | <b><font color="red">Advantage</font></b>: Detects biochemical changes before structural changes appear on CT/MRI. |

* In <b><font color="red">MRI</font></b>, use of gadolinium contrast carries a risk of <b><font color="red">Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis</font></b>, especially in patients with preexisting renal failure; check BUN/Creatinine/GFR first.
* <b><font color="red">Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</font></b> is the imaging of choice for <b><font color="red">transverse myelitis</font></b>, neuropathies, and spinal cord tumors.
* <b><font color="red">Computed Tomography (CT)</font></b> is superior to MRI for visualizing <b><font color="red">calcium, fat, and bone</font></b> (skull base/vertebrae) and is faster for emergent herniation cases.

### <b><font color="red">Neuroimaging: Invasive Modalities</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Cerebral Angiography</font></b> is the <b><font color="red">invasive gold standard</font></b> for visualizing small vessel tributaries and collaterals using a catheter and dye.
* <b><font color="red">CT Myelography (CTM)</font></b> uses <b><font color="red">intrathecal contrast</font></b> to assess spinal canal stenosis specifically when <b><font color="red">MRI is contraindicated</font></b>.

### <b><font color="red">Neurophysiology and Electrophysiology</font></b>

| Test | Subject of Evaluation | Common Indications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b><font color="red">EMG / NCV</font></b> | Muscles and peripheral nerves. | <b><font color="red">Neuropathies</font></b> (Diabetic, Carpal Tunnel), <b><font color="red">Myopathy</font></b> (Dystrophies), Myasthenia Gravis. |
| <b><font color="red">EEG</font></b> | Cerebral electrical activity. | Epilepsy support, <b><font color="red">nonconvulsive status epilepticus</font></b>, coma, GDD. |
| <b><font color="red">BAER</font></b> | Brainstem auditory pathways. | Assessing hearing in <b><font color="red">infants exposed to ototoxic drugs</font></b> or uncooperative children. |
| <b><font color="red">SEP</font></b> | Spinal cord and brainstem sensory pathways. | Brain death analysis, <b><font color="red">multiple sclerosis</font></b>, spinal cord lesions causing numbness. |
| <b><font color="red">VEP</font></b> | Anterior visual pathways to occipital cortex. | Sudden vision loss; rules out <b><font color="red">central/hysterical blindness</font></b> vs demyelinating issues. |

* In <b><font color="red">Electromyography (EMG)</font></b>, a needle is used to record muscle action potentials, while <b><font color="red">Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV)</font></b> uses a probe to measure signal speed.
* <b><font color="red">Electroencephalogram (EEG)</font></b> is NOT used to diagnose epilepsy (which is a clinical diagnosis) but serves as a <b><font color="red">supportive diagnostic tool</font></b>.
* To enhance detection of epileptiform activity during an <b><font color="red">EEG</font></b>, patients should undergo <b><font color="red">mild sleep deprivation</font></b> and avoid caffeine.
* Activating procedures during an <b><font color="red">EEG</font></b> include <b><font color="red">Hyperventilation</font></b> (3 mins) and <b><font color="red">Photic Stimulation</font></b> (strobe light at 1-20 Hz).
* In <b><font color="red">Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)</font></b>, a normal response in a blind patient suggests the lesion is not in the anterior visual pathways (example: <b><font color="red">hysterical blindness</font></b>).

### <b><font color="red">Lumbar Puncture (LP) and CSF Analysis</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Lumbar Puncture (LP)</font></b> is the <b><font color="red">gold standard</font></b> for diagnosing CNS infections (bacterial, viral, or aseptic).
* The <b><font color="red">absolute contraindication</font></b> for <b><font color="red">LP</font></b> is <b><font color="red">infection at the site of the tap</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Relative contraindications</font></b> for <b><font color="red">LP</font></b> include increased ICP (sensory changes/drowsiness), coagulopathy, and space-occupying lesions.
* The <b><font color="red">6 layers</font></b> passed during a <b><font color="red">Lumbar Puncture</font></b> are: 1) Skin, 2) Subcutaneous fat, 3) Supraspinous ligament, 4) Intraspinous ligament, 5) <b><font color="red">Ligamentum flavum</font></b> (1st pop), and 6) <b><font color="red">Dura</font></b> (2nd pop).
* For an <b><font color="red">LP</font></b>, an imaginary line between the <b><font color="red">superior iliac crests</font></b> identifies the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspaces.
* During an <b><font color="red">LP</font></b>, always get <b><font color="red">baseline serum sugar</font></b> first; the normal <b><font color="red">CSF-to-serum glucose ratio</font></b> is approximately 0.6 (60-70%).
* The most common complication of a <b><font color="red">Lumbar Puncture (LP)</font></b> is <b><font color="red">Post-dural puncture headache</font></b>, which occurs when the patient is upright.
* In adults, the <b><font color="red">spinal cord</font></b> typically terminates at <b><font color="red">L1</font></b>, while the subarachnoid space ends at <b><font color="red">S1-S2</font></b>.

### <b><font color="red">Definitions of Seizure and Epilepsy</font></b>

* A <b><font color="red">Seizure</font></b> is an abnormal, excessive discharge of brain neurons involving <b><font color="red">hypersynchrony</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Epileptic Seizure</font></b> is a transient occurrence of signs/symptoms due to abnormal <b><font color="red">excessive or synchronous</font></b> neuronal activity.
* <b><font color="red">Epilepsy</font></b> is a brain disorder characterized by an <b><font color="red">enduring predisposition</font></b> to generate seizures.
* <b><font color="red">Diagnosis of Epilepsy</font></b> requires: 1) ≥2 unprovoked seizures >24h apart, 2) 1 unprovoked seizure with high recurrence risk (≥60%) over 10 years, or 3) an epilepsy syndrome.
* <b><font color="red">Provoked (Reactive) Seizures</font></b> result from transient factors (fever, hyponatremia, trauma) in a <b><font color="red">normal brain</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Unprovoked Seizures</font></b> have no temporary/reversible factor lowering the seizure threshold.

### <b><font color="red">Epidemiology and Mortality (SUDEP)</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Epilepsy</font></b> is the <b><font color="red">second most common</font></b> neurologic condition after headache.
* <b><font color="red">SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy)</font></b> is a diagnosis of exclusion; it often involves <b><font color="red">nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures</font></b>.
* Risk factors for <b><font color="red">SUDEP</font></b> include <b><font color="red">Dravet syndrome</font></b>, uncontrolled GTC seizures, and AED levels below therapeutic range.
* <b><font color="red">Definite SUDEP</font></b> requires autopsy confirmation, while <b><font color="red">Probable SUDEP</font></b> meets clinical criteria but lacks postmortem data.

### <b><font color="red">Seizure Classification and Clinical Types</font></b>

| Seizure Type | Involvement | Consciousness | Clinical Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b><font color="red">Focal (Aware)</font></b> | One hemisphere/localized area. | <b><font color="red">Intact</font></b> | Simple motor/sensory symptoms based on lobe. |
| <b><font color="red">Focal (Impaired Awareness)</font></b> | One hemisphere. | <b><font color="red">Lost/Impaired</font></b> | <b><font color="red">Automatisms</font></b> (frothing, salivation); common in temporal lobe. |
| <b><font color="red">Generalized Motor</font></b> | Bilateral hemispheres. | <b><font color="red">Lost/Impaired</font></b> | Tonic (tone), Clonic (jerking), Atonic (loss of tone). |
| <b><font color="red">Absence (Non-motor)</font></b> | Bilateral hemispheres. | <b><font color="red">Lost (seconds)</font></b> | <b><font color="red">Staring spells</font></b>; 3 Hz spike-and-wave on EEG. |

* <b><font color="red">Complex Partial Seizure</font></b> is now termed <b><font color="red">Focal Impaired Awareness Seizure</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Petit Mal (Absence)</font></b> seizures can occur hundreds of times a day and terminate abruptly with no post-ictal confusion.
* <b><font color="red">Aura</font></b> and <b><font color="red">Post-ictal confusion</font></b> are <b><font color="red">hallmarks of Focal seizures</font></b> that involve consciousness (Complex Partial).
* <b><font color="red">Unknown Onset</font></b> (formerly Unclassified) is typical of <b><font color="red">neonatal seizures</font></b> because the brain is not yet organized.

### <b><font color="red">Seizure Mimics and Differentials</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Syncope</font></b> is the most common mimic (44%); it is usually associated with <b><font color="red">pallor</font></b> and an upright position, unlike seizures.
* <b><font color="red">Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)</font></b> are often theatrical, prolonged, and occur in the <b><font color="red">presence of others</font></b> with normal EEG.
* <b><font color="red">Transient Global Amnesia</font></b> involves sudden loss of episodic memory in patients >50, often triggered by stress; consciousness remains intact.
* <b><font color="red">Sleep Myoclonus</font></b> (Somnolescent Starts) are <b><font color="red">non-epileptic</font></b> jerks occuring at sleep onset, often worsened by stress.
* <b><font color="red">Paroxysmal Abdominal Pain</font></b> can be a form of epilepsy presenting as <b><font color="red">periumbilical pain</font></b> with abnormal EEG.
* <b><font color="red">Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)</font></b> is diagnosed by the <b><font color="red">Dix-Hallpike maneuver</font></b> and treated by the <b><font color="red">Epley maneuver</font></b>.

### <b><font color="red">Pharmacotherapy of Seizures</font></b>

* <b><font color="red">Ethosuximide</font></b> is the <b><font color="red">first-line drug</font></b> for <b><font color="red">Absence Seizures</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Valproic acid</font></b> is a second-line for absence but should be avoided in <b><font color="red">pregnant females or those with PCOS</font></b> due to teratogenicity and weight gain.
* <b><font color="red">Carbamazepine</font></b> is the Drug of Choice (DOC) for <b><font color="red">Focal/Complex Partial Seizures</font></b>.
* <b><font color="red">Carbamazepine</font></b> is associated with <b><font color="red">SJS/TEN</font></b>, especially in patients with the <b><font color="red">HLA-B*1502</font></b> allele (common in SE Asia).
* <b><font color="red">Carbamazepine</font></b> is unique for <b><font color="red">autoinduction</font></b>, inducing its own metabolism via CYP3A4.
* <b><font color="red">Oxcarbazepine</font></b> carries a significant risk for <b><font color="red">hyponatremia</font></b> (Serum Na+ ≤120 mEq/L can trigger seizures).

### <b><font color="red">Comparative Differentiating Features</font></b>

1. Compare <b><font color="red">Syncope vs. Seizure</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Syncope</font></b> presents with pallor and gradual onset; <b><font color="red">Seizure</font></b> presents with cyanosis/normal color and sudden onset.

3. Compare <b><font color="red">Absence vs. Complex Partial</font></b> EEG: <b><font color="red">Absence</font></b> shows generalized 3 Hz spikes; <b><font color="red">Complex Partial</font></b> shows focal discharges.
4. Compare <b><font color="red">CT vs. MRI</font></b> speed: <b><font color="red">CT</font></b> takes ~5 minutes (ideal for trauma); <b><font color="red">MRI</font></b> takes 30-60 minutes.
5. Compare <b><font color="red">EEG vs. Epilepsy Diagnosis</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Epilepsy</font></b> is a clinical diagnosis; <b><font color="red">EEG</font></b> may be normal even in confirmed epilepsy.
6. Differentiate <b><font color="red">Provoked vs. Unprovoked</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Provoked</font></b> has an acute systemic trigger (e.g., hyponatremia); <b><font color="red">Unprovoked</font></b> suggests an enduring predisposition.
7. Compare <b><font color="red">GTC vs. Absence</font></b>: <b><font color="red">GTC</font></b> is convulsive with tonic-clonic phases; <b><font color="red">Absence</font></b> is non-motor staring.
8. Compare <b><font color="red">Night Terrors vs. Nightmares</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Night Terrors</font></b> occur in NREM (deep sleep) with no memory; <b><font color="red">Nightmares</font></b> occur in REM with vivid recall.
9. Compare <b><font color="red">MRI vs. X-ray</font></b> energy: <b><font color="red">MRI</font></b> uses nonionizing (magnets); <b><font color="red">X-ray/CT</font></b> uses ionizing radiation.
10. Compare <b><font color="red">Carbamazepine vs. Oxcarbazepine</font></b> side effects: <b><font color="red">Carbamazepine</font></b> is linked to SJS (HLA-B*1502); <b><font color="red">Oxcarbazepine</font></b> is linked to hyponatremia.
11. Compare <b><font color="red">MRA vs. Cerebral Angiogram</font></b>: <b><font color="red">MRA</font></b> is noninvasive (Circle of Willis); <b><font color="red">Angiogram</font></b> is invasive (catheter/dye for small vessels).
12. Compare <b><font color="red">Adult vs. Pediatric Neurology Exam</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Adults</font></b> follow a structured head-to-toe; <b><font color="red">Pediatrics</font></b> depends highly on child cooperation/observation.
13. Compare <b><font color="red">Movement Disorders vs. Seizures</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Movement disorders</font></b> are absent in sleep and worsen with emotion; <b><font color="red">Seizures</font></b> can occur during sleep.
14. Compare <b><font color="red">Simple Focal vs. Complex Focal</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Simple</font></b> has preserved consciousness (Aware); <b><font color="red">Complex</font></b> has impaired consciousness.
15. Compare <b><font color="red">Ethosuximide vs. Zonisamide</font></b>: <b><font color="red">Ethosuximide</font></b> is 1st line for absence; <b><font color="red">Zonisamide</font></b> is preferred if avoiding weight gain/teratogenicity in PCOS.

### **Topic: Approach to Epilepsy & Automatisms**

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | **<font color="red">Automatisms</font>** are coordinated, repetitive, motor activities that occur when awareness is impaired, arising from "central pattern generators" in the brainstem when cortical control is disrupted. |
| **Types** | **<font color="red">Automatisms</font>** include Orofacial (lip-smacking), Manual/Gestural (picking/rubbing), Hypermotor (pelvic thrusting/cycling), Ictal Speech, and Dystonic Posturing. |
| **Source/Anatomy** | **<font color="red">Orofacial automatisms</font>** are highly sensitive for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, while **<font color="red">Hypermotor behavior</font>** is highly specific for the Frontal Lobe. |
| **Release Phenomenon**| In **<font color="red">Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures</font>**, manual picking or fumbling are considered "release phenomena" where primitive brain centers take over because higher-order executive functions are "turned off." |
| **Emergency Criteria** | In **<font color="red">Seizure Management</font>**, call 911 if: it is a first-time event, lasts >5 mins, occurs in water, or if the patient is pregnant or diabetic. |

### **Topic: Epileptic Syndromes - Classifications & Neonatal Fits**

| Syndrome | Key High-Yield Facts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | **<font color="red">Symptomatic Epilepsy</font>** has a known cause (e.g., tumor/bleed); **<font color="red">Cryptogenic</font>** is presumed genetic but cause is unidentifiable on imaging; **<font color="red">Idiopathic</font>** has normal CNS function and imaging. |
| **BINC** | **<font color="red">Benign Idiopathic Neonatal Convulsions (BINC)</font>** also known as **"Fifth Day Fits"**, typically occurs on day 5 of life, and may be linked to low CNS zinc or Rotavirus. |
| **BFNC** | **<font color="red">Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions (BFNC)</font>** occurs on days 2-3 of life, is Autosomal Dominant (Chromosome 20), and has a higher risk (11-16%) of future seizures compared to BINC. |
| **Neonatal DOC** | **<font color="red">Phenobarbital</font>** is the Drug of Choice for neonatal seizures as it has fewer side effects in neonates than older children; its most common side effect in this age group is rashes. |

### **Topic: Generalized Epilepsies (Absence, JME, Jeavons)**

| Condition | Clinical & EEG Findings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Absence (CAE)** | **<font color="red">Childhood Absence Epilepsy (Pyknolepsy)</font>** peaks at age 6-7, features staring spells/ eyelid myoclonia, and is characterized by a 3-Hz spike-and-slow-wave EEG pattern. |
| **Juvenile Absence (JAE)** | **<font color="red">Juvenile Absence Epilepsy</font>** has an older onset (8-26 years) than CAE, has less frequent attacks, and 80% of patients will develop Tonic-Clonic seizures. |
| **Absence Treatment** | **<font color="red">Ethosuximide</font>** is the Drug of Choice for Absence seizures. If using **<font color="red">Valproic Acid</font>**, monitor for PCOs, hepatotoxicity, and weight gain; it is teratogenic (NTDs) and avoided in women of child-bearing age. |
| **Jeavons Syndrome** | **<font color="red">Jeavons Syndrome</font>** is characterized by prominent eyelid jerking triggered by eye closure and 3-6 Hz generalized polyspike-and-wave complexes on EEG; all patients are photosensitive. |
| **JME Definition** | **<font color="red">Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)</font>** is the most common idiopathic epilepsy syndrome in adolescents (peak age 15), often involving Chromosome 6. |
| **JME Triggers** | **<font color="red">Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)</font>** seizures are triggered by the **SSAP** factors: **S**tress, lack of **S**leep, **A**lcohol, and **P**hotic stimulation (Photosensitivity). |
| **JME Treatment** | **<font color="red">Valproic Acid</font>** is the 80% effective DOC for JME, followed by Levetiracetam as a first-line alternative. |

### **Topic: Focal Epilepsies & Special Syndromes**

| Condition | Unique Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Benign Rolandic** | **<font color="red">Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (BCECTS)</font>** is the most common childhood epilepsy syndrome (peak 8-9 years), involving nocturnal facial twitching, drooling (hypersalivation), and speech arrest. |
| **Rolandic Treatment** | **<font color="red">Carbamazepine</font>** is the First-line drug of choice for Benign Rolandic Epilepsy, though many children "outgrow" the condition and may not require AEDs if seizures are infrequent. |
| **Rasmussen's** | **<font color="red">Rasmussen’s Encephalitis</font>** is a rare unilateral inflammatory disease (starts age 1-14) causing progressive hemisphere atrophy; it is associated with GluR3 auto-antibodies. |
| **Rasmussen's Surgery** | **<font color="red">Hemispherectomy</font>** is the most effective treatment for reducing seizures in Rasmussen’s Encephalitis if the patient is refractory to immunotherapy and steroids. |
| **Landau-Kleffner** | **<font color="red">Landau-Kleffner Syndrome</font>** (Acquired Epileptic Aphasia) involves the sudden failure of expressive speech development (Broca’s area) in a child around age 1, with sleep-activated EEG discharges. |
| **Reflex Seizures** | **<font color="red">Reflex Seizures</font>** are provoked by specific external stimuli (Musicogenic, reading, hot water, or photic/TV); patients should use "desensitization" strategies like watching TV from 2 meters away. |

### **Topic: Status Epilepticus (SE)**

| Phase | Management / Pharmacology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SE Definition** | **<font color="red">Status Epilepticus</font>** is operationally defined as seizures persisting >5 minutes (as they are unlikely to stop spontaneously), though the classic definition is 30 minutes. |
| **1st Line SE** | **<font color="red">Short-acting Benzodiazepines</font>** (Diazepam or Lorazepam) are given IV to stop SE as quickly as possible; Lorazepam is preferred if cardiopulmonary issues exist. |
| **2nd Line SE** | **<font color="red">Long-acting AEDs</font>** for SE include IV Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Valproic Acid, or Levetiracetam; if 4 drugs are used to stop the seizure, all 4 must be maintained in the maintenance dose. |
| **Refractory SE** | **<font color="red">Midazolam Drip</font>** or induced coma (Pentobarbital/Propofol) is required if initial long-acting AEDs fail to stop Status Epilepticus. |
| **Metabolic Care** | In **<font color="red">Status Epilepticus</font>**, intractable metabolic acidosis is a common cause of death, followed by renal shutdown; avoid giving antihypertensives during the attack as BP may crash post-ictally. |
| **Supportive SE** | **<font color="red">Thiamine (Vit B1)</font>** and Dextrose should be administered in cases of Status Epilepticus, especially in alcoholics or pediatric patients where the nutritional history is unknown. |

### **Topic: Involuntary Movement Disorders - Tremors**

| Tremor Type | Differentiating Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | **<font color="red">Movement Disorders</font>** (Dyskinesias) are generally absent during sleep and present only when the patient is awake. |
| **Parkinsonian** | **<font color="red">Parkinsonian Tremor</font>** is a resting "pill-rolling" tremor that is usually unilateral at onset and is associated with decreased facial expression and cogwheel rigidity. |
| **Essential** | **<font color="red">Essential Tremor</font>** is the most common tremor; it is a postural/action tremor (affects hands/voice), often has a positive family history, and involves a "yes-yes" or "no-no" head motion. |
| **Essential Tx** | **<font color="red">Beta Blockers</font>** (Propranolol) and **<font color="red">Alcohol</font>** are often beneficial in reducing Essential Tremor, whereas alcohol is not beneficial for Parkinsonian tremors. |
| **Cerebellar** | **<font color="red">Cerebellar Tremor</font>** (Intention tremor) is a slow, broad tremor occurring at the end of purposeful movement and is often accompanied by Ataxia, Nystagmus, and Dysarthria. |
| **Titubation**| **<font color="red">Titubation</font>** is a specific tremor of the head originating from cerebellar pathology. |
| **Dystonic** | **<font color="red">Dystonic Tremor</font>** can be relieved by a *geste antagoniste* (touching the affected body part) and involves sustained involuntary muscle contractions. |
| **Orthostatic** | **<font color="red">Orthostatic Tremor</font>** involves rhythmic muscle contractions (>12 Hz) in the legs that occur immediately upon standing and disappear once weight-bearing stops. |
| **Psychogenic** | **<font color="red">Psychogenic Tremor</font>** (Hysterical) has an abrupt onset, is unresponsive to AEDs, and disappears when the patient is distracted. |

### **Topic: Chorea & Other Hyperkinetic Disorders**

| Condition | High-Yield Diagnostics & Signs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sydenham’s** | **<font color="red">Sydenham’s Chorea</font>** is a major CNS feature of Rheumatic Fever (GABHS infection) caused by molecular mimicry against the Basal Ganglia (caudate and putamen). |
| **Sydenham’s Signs** | Signs of **<font color="red">Sydenham’s Chorea</font>** include "Milkmaid grip" (relapsing grip), "Chameleon tongue" (darting tongue), and "Piano hand" (flowing finger movements). |
| **Sydenham’s Tx** | **<font color="red">Haloperidol</font>** is the drug of choice for Sydenham’s Chorea, but patients must also receive a 10-day course of Penicillin followed by long-term prophylaxis. |
| **Wilson’s Disease** | **<font color="red">Wilson’s Disease</font>** (Hepatolenticular degeneration) is an Autosomal Recessive disorder (Chromosome 13, ATP7B gene) leading to toxic copper accumulation in the liver and brain. |
| **Wilson’s Signs** | **<font color="red">Wilson’s Disease</font>** is diagnosed via low ceruloplasmin, high urine copper, and the presence of **Kayser-Fleischer rings** in the eyes. |
| **Wilson’s Tx** | **<font color="red">Penicillamine</font>** (to remove copper) and **<font color="red">Zinc Acetate</font>** (to prevent absorption) are the primary treatments for Wilson’s Disease. |
| **Chorea Gravidarum**| **<font color="red">Chorea Gravidarum</font>** is a rare chorea occurring during pregnancy; 60% of cases occur in women with a prior history of Sydenham’s Choreas. |
| **Neuroacanthocytosis**| **<font color="red">Neuroacanthocytosis</font>** is a genetic disorder where 10-30% of RBCs appear "starlike" or "thorny" (Acanthocytes), associated with axonal neuropathy and chorea. |
| **Huntington’s** | **<font color="red">Huntington’s Disease</font>** is a progressive genetic disorder where chorea is a primary feature, often associated with dementia and cortical atrophy. |

### **Differentiating Similar Entities (Comparison Review)**

*   **<font color="red">CAE vs. JAE</font>**: **Childhood Absence Epilepsy** occurs in school-age children (peaks 6-7 years) and is very frequent; **Juvenile Absence Epilepsy** occurs in adolescence and carries a much higher risk (80%) of developing generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
*   **<font color="red">BINC vs. BFNC</font>**: **Benign Idiopathic Neonatal Convulsions** (BINC) occurs on day 5 ("5th day fits") and is usually self-limited with low recurrence; **Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions** (BFNC) occurs earlier (day 2-3) and has a significant family history (Chromosome 20).
*   **<font color="red">Essential vs. Parkinsonian Tremor</font>**: **Essential tremor** is bilateral, postural/action-based, and responds to alcohol; **Parkinsonian tremor** is unilateral at onset, a resting tremor, and does *not* respond to alcohol but responds to L-Dopa.
*   **<font color="red">Chorea vs. Athetosis</font>**: **Chorea** involves rapid, jerky, "dance-like" involuntary movements; **Athetosis** involves slow, writhing, twisting contortions, typically affecting the distal upper limbs.
*   **<font color="red">Hemiballismus vs. Chorea</font>**: **Hemiballismus** involves violent, large-amplitude flinging movements of one side of the body; **Chorea** involves smaller, semi-purposeful "dancing" movements.
*   **<font color="red">Common AED Side Effects</font>**: **Carbamazepine** is associated with SJS/TEN (Check HLA-B*1502); **Oxcarbazepine** is notorious for causing hyponatremia; **Valproic Acid** causes weight gain and PCOS.
*   **<font color="red">Syncope vs. Seizure (from source 1.1 clues)</font>**: **Syncope** usually has a gradual onset with pallor; **Seizures** are sudden and may involve cyanosis and "automatisms."
*   **<font color="red">Night Terrors vs. Seizures</font>**: **Night Terrors** occur in NREM sleep and the patient has no memory; **Seizures** can be confirmed with EEG and often have post-ictal states.
*   **<font color="red">Idiopathic vs. Symptomatic</font>**: **Idiopathic** means the patient is otherwise normal with a presumed genetic cause; **Symptomatic** means there is a clear structural brain insult (tumor, stroke, or old injury).
*   **<font color="red">Status Epilepticus Pharmacology</font>**: **Diazepam** is the fast-acting "fire extinguisher" to stop the seizure; **Phenytoin/Phenobarbital** are the "stabilizers" given to prevent the fire from restarting (maintenance).
*   **<font color="red">Wilson's Disease vs. Sydenham's</font>**: **Wilson's** is a metabolic/genetic copper disorder with liver involvement; **Sydenham's** is an autoimmune post-streptococcal complication with no liver involvement.
*   **<font color="red">Cerebellar vs. Movement Disorders</font>**: **Cerebellar** lesions cause intention tremors and ataxia (negative and positive features); **Basal Ganglia** disorders cause resting tremors, chorea, or rigidity.

### **Topic: Seizure Classification (2025 ILAE Classification)**

- In accordance with the 2025 ILAE Classification, **<font color="red">Focal Seizures</font>** are now more clearly distinguished into **<font color="red">Focal Seizures with Preserved Awareness (FPC)</font>** and **<font color="red">Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness (FIC)</font>**.
- The formula for **<font color="red">Seizure Clinical Documentation</font>** is defined as: **Class + Classifier + Basic Descriptor: Expanded Descriptor**.
- **<font color="red">Focal Preserved Consciousness Seizure (FPC)</font>**, formerly known as "Simple Partial Seizure," occurs while awareness and consciousness are fully preserved.
- **<font color="red">Jacksonian March</font>** is a type of Focal Motor (Frontal) seizure characterized by tonic/clonic contractions spreading from distal to proximal muscles (e.g., hand → arm → face).
- **<font color="red">Adversive Seizures</font>** involve the sustained turning of the head and eyes to the side opposite the seizure focus.
- **<font color="red">Somatosensory Seizures</font>** originate in the parietal lobe and manifest as numbness or tingling contralateral to the focus.
- **<font color="red">Visual Seizures</font>** originate in the occipital lobe and manifest as flashes of light, sparks, or darkness.
- **<font color="red">Olfactory Seizures (Uncinate Fits)</font>** originate in the medial temporal lobe/uncus and are characterized by unpleasant or foul odors.
- **<font color="red">Temporal Lobe Aura</font>** consists of subjective warnings that precede impairment, such as déjà vu, fear, or a rising epigastric sensation.
- **<font color="red">Focal-to-Bilateral Tonic-Clonic Seizure (FBTC)</font>**, formerly "Secondarily Generalized," is differentiated from primary generalized seizures by a clear focal onset (aura or focal motor sign).
- **<font color="red">Typical Absence Seizures (TA)</font>** are brief (2–10s) lapses of consciousness with a classic **3-Hz spike-and-wave** EEG pattern, often triggered by hyperventilation.
- **<font color="red">Atypical Absence Seizures (AA)</font>** have a slower onset/offset and show a slower (1–2 Hz) or irregular spike-and-wave EEG pattern.
- **<font color="red">Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTC)</font>** follow a sequence of a **Tonic Phase** (stiffening, cyanosis, epileptic cry) followed by a **Clonic Phase** (rhythmic jerking, autonomic activation).
- **<font color="red">Generalized Atonic Seizures (GA)</font>** are also known as "drop attacks" due to the sudden loss of postural tone.
- **<font color="red">Todd’s Paralysis</font>** is a focal neurological deficit (such as weakness) that occurs in the postictal period following a seizure.

### **Topic: Tremors & Movement Disorders**

- **<font color="red">FPC vs. FIC Seizures</font>**: Focal Preserved Consciousness (FPC) means the patient is alert and aware; Focal Impaired Consciousness (FIC) involves a lack of awareness during the event.
- **<font color="red">Jacksonian March vs. Adversive Seizure</font>**: Jacksonian march is the **spread of movement** through a limb; Adversive is a **static, sustained turn** of the head.
- **<font color="red">Primary vs. Secondary Dystonia</font>**: Primary is usually genetic/idiopathic; Secondary is caused by an insult (stroke, infection, trauma) to the **basal ganglia**.
- **<font color="red">Lubag vs. Sydenham's Chorea</font>**: Lubag is **progressive** and genetic; Sydenham's is usually **self-limited** and post-infectious (Rheumatic fever).
