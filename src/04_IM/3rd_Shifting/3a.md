### CHAPTER 356: SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)

**OVERVIEW & EPIDEMIOLOGY**
*   Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease where damage to organs is mediated by autoantibodies and immune complex deposits.
*   SLE is 5-6 times more common in females than males, with 90% of patients being females of child-bearing age.
*   The prevalence of SLE is highest in African-American and Afro-Caribbean women and lowest in white men.
*   In most SLE patients, autoantibodies are present for a few years before the first clinical symptom appears.
*   The disease course of SLE for ~85% of patients involves active disease or flares annually, with less than 5% achieving permanent complete remission.

**SLE: PATHOGENESIS, ETIOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FINDINGS**

| Feature             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Pathogenesis**    | - **Core Mechanism:** Interactions between susceptible genes and environmental factors lead to the production of autoantibodies and immune complexes, causing multisystem tissue damage.<br>- **Innate Immunity:** Activation of innate immunity, mainly dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophages, is a key initiating step. These cells produce IFN-alpha, which creates a genetic "signature" seen in up to 80% of SLE patients.<br>- **IFN-alpha:** Approximately 50% of known predisposing genes for SLE influence IFN production/function. The increased gene expression pattern related to IFN-alpha is the most characteristic for SLE.***<br>- **Immune Cells:** The pathogenesis involves lowered activation thresholds of B and T cells, ineffective regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Genetic Factors** | - **Multigenetic:** SLE is a multigenetic disease with abnormalities in HLA molecules, immunity pathway genes, lymphocyte signaling, apoptosis, and clearance of apoptotic cells/immune complexes (C1q, C2, C4).<br>- **ESRD-Associated Genes:** The `MYH9/APOL1` gene is associated with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in all ancestries. The `APOL1G1/G2` variants are associated with ESRD only in African Americans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Environmental Factors** | - **UV Light***: The UV-B spectrum is a more potent trigger than UV-A. It alters skin cell DNA (increasing thymine dimers) and intracellular proteins, making them more antigenic, and causes apoptosis of keratinocytes.<br>- **Infection:** Infections, particularly with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), can activate autoreactive T and B cells through mechanisms like molecular mimicry. EBV infects B cells and can alter their function.<br>- **Female Hormones:** Estradiol can bind to receptors on T and B cells, increasing the activation, survival, and activity of abnormal immune cells.<br>- **Others:** Tobacco smoking, prolonged exposure to silica (e.g., soap powder dust, soil), air pollution, and pesticides are other environmental triggers. |
| **Classification Criteria** | - **Purpose:** Classification criteria (like SLICC or EULAR/ACR) serve as a guide for diagnosis and are primarily designed for standardizing patient groups in clinical trials.<br>- **SLICC Criteria (2012):** A patient is classified as having SLE if they have at least 4 criteria, with at least 1 clinical and 1 immunologic criterion. A renal biopsy showing lupus nephritis with any lupus autoantibody also qualifies.<br>- **EULAR/ACR Criteria (2019):** This is the latest criteria. It uses a scoring system requiring an entry criterion of a positive ANA test (≥1:80). A score of 10 or more points classifies the patient as having SLE. |

| **Systemic Symptoms**             | - Common initial symptoms of SLE include fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias.<br>- Severe systemic illness in SLE can present with fever, weight loss, anemia, and prostration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Mucocutaneous Manifestations**  | - **Malar Rash (Acute):** An erythematous, elevated, pruritic rash in the malar area that spares the nasolabial folds. It is precipitated by sunlight and heals without scarring. Worsening often accompanies a flare of systemic disease.<br>- **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus (SCLE):** Consists of scaly red patches (psoriasiform) or circular flat red-rimmed lesions (annular). The face is typically spared. Patients are exquisitely photosensitive and often have anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies.<br>- **Discoid Lupus (DLE) (Chronic):** Circular, raised, scaly, hyperpigmented rims with depigmented, atrophic centers that heal with scarring and dyspigmentation. Only 5% of people with DLE develop SLE.<br>- **Non-scarring Alopecia:** Hair loss can affect all body hair and typically grows back.<br>- **Mucosal Ulcers:** Oral ulcers are typically painless and are NOT associated with disease activity. Nasal ulcers, found on the lower nasal septum, ARE associated with disease activity. |
| **Musculoskeletal Manifestations** | - **Arthritis:** SLE arthritis presents similarly to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) affecting the hands, knees, and wrists, but it is RARELY the erosive type.<br>- **Myositis:** SLE can cause proximal muscle myositis. It must be differentiated from weakness caused by other factors, such as high-dose steroid therapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Renal Manifestations**          | - **Lupus Nephritis (LN)** is the most serious manifestation of SLE and a leading cause of mortality.<br>- Presentation can range from nephrotic to nephritic syndrome.<br>- A **renal biopsy** is crucial for diagnosis and guiding therapy.<br>- Classes III, IV, and V LN require aggressive treatment, while Classes I, II, or VI (irreversible damage) are managed with standard SLE treatment.<br>- **Lupus Nephritis Classes:**<br>  - Class I: Minimal Mesangial LN<br>  - Class II: Mesangial Proliferative LN<br>  - Class III: Focal LN<br>  - Class IV: Diffuse LN<br>  - Class V: Membranous LN<br>  - Class VI: Advanced Sclerosis LN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **CNS and Vascular Manifestations** | - **CNS Lupus** can present as a diffuse process (headache, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction) or a vascular occlusive disease (stroke, TIA).<br>- Steroid-induced psychosis (from ≥40mg/day prednisone for at least 1 week) must be ruled out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Pulmonary Manifestations**        | - The **most common** pulmonary manifestation of SLE is **Pleuritis**, with or without pleural effusion.<br>- Other serious manifestations include Lupus Pneumonitis, Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), shrinking lung syndrome, and intra-alveolar hemorrhage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Cardiac Manifestations**        | - The **most frequent** cardiac manifestation of SLE is **Pericarditis**.<br>- Other serious cardiac issues include myocarditis, valvular heart disease (Libman-Sacks vegetations on mitral/aortic valves), and myocardial infarction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Hematologic Manifestations**    | - The **most frequent** hematologic manifestation of SLE is anemia, typically normochromic normocytic anemia of chronic illness.<br>- Hemolytic anemia is also a key feature of SLE.<br>- SLE can cause **leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia**, which is a distinguishing feature from other connective tissue diseases that typically cause leukocytosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Gastrointestinal Manifestations** | - Common GI symptoms in SLE are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br>- Liver enzymes may be elevated in active SLE, requiring exclusion of primary liver problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Ocular Manifestations**         | - Sicca syndrome (Sjögren's) and nonspecific conjunctivitis are common in SLE.<br>- Serious manifestations that can threaten vision include retinal vasculitis and optic neuritis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Diagnosis**        | - **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Test:** The most important screening test, positive in >95% of SLE patients. A titer of 1:80 or higher is considered significant.<br>- **SLE-Specific Antibodies:** `Anti-dsDNA` and `Anti-Sm` are highly specific for SLE. `Anti-dsDNA` levels often correlate with disease activity, while `Anti-Sm` levels do not.<br>- **Antiphospholipid (APS) Antibodies:** Not specific to SLE but their presence increases the risk for thrombosis and fetal loss.<br>- **Complement C3 and C4:** Levels are often low in active SLE and can be used to monitor disease activity.<br>- **Standard Tests:** A complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis are essential screening tests. |
| **Treatment (Non-Life-Threatening)** | - **Hydroxychloroquine***: All lupus patients should take hydroxychloroquine. It is effective for rash, alopecia, and arthritis, and it decreases the risk of thrombosis and lupus flares. Requires an annual eye exam.<br>- **Other treatments:** Low-dose or topical steroids, NSAIDs for arthritis, and sunscreen (at least SPF 30) are standard. Methotrexate can be used for more severe arthritis and rash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Treatment (Life-Threatening)**    | - **Mainstay:** This applies to any organ involvement (e.g., nephritis, CNS lupus) or disease non-responsive to standard care. The mainstay of treatment is high-dose glucocorticoids (e.g., oral prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day or IV pulse methylprednisolone).<br>- **Induction Therapy for LN:** In addition to high-dose steroids, an immunosuppressant is added. Options include `Cyclophosphamide` (standard, risk of ovarian failure) or `Mycophenolate Mofetil` (MMF, preferred for fertility preservation). A combination of Calcineurin inhibitors + MMF is another option.<br>- **Maintenance Therapy for LN:** After induction, lifelong maintenance therapy with `Azathioprine` or `Mycophenolate` is required to prevent flares.<br>- **Biologics:** For severe or refractory disease, biologics like `Rituximab` (anti-CD20), `Belimumab` (anti-BLyS, for LN), and `Anifrolumab` (anti-Type I IFN, for skin/joints) may be used. |
| **SLE and Pregnancy** | - **Fertility:** Fertility rates in SLE patients are normal.<br>- **Fetal Loss:** The rate of fetal loss is increased in SLE, especially with high disease activity, active nephritis, or positive antiphospholipid antibodies.<br>- **Pre-conception:** Patients should be in remission for at least 6 months prior to pregnancy for a better outcome.<br>- **Anti-Ro Antibodies:** ALL pregnant women with SLE must be tested for anti-Ro antibodies; if positive, there is a high risk for congenital heart block in the fetus.<br>- **Medications:** Prednisone and hydroxychloroquine are generally safe. Azathioprine can be used if necessary. Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Cyclophosphamide are teratogenic and must be stopped at least 3 months before conception. |

| **Definition & Epidemiology** | - APS is an autoantibody-mediated acquired thrombophilia characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, plus the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).<br>- **Catastrophic APS (CAPS)** is a rapidly progressive thromboembolic disease involving three or more organs.<br>- About 30-40% of SLE patients have positive aPLs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Pathogenesis**     | - A **"two-hit" theory** is proposed. The "first hit" is the formation of aPLs (e.g., due to infection, molecular mimicry). The "second hit" is a trigger (e.g., infection, surgery, estrogen) that leads to thrombosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Antibodies**       | - **Lupus Anticoagulant (LA):** A functional test that detects antibodies prolonging phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests.<br>- **Anti-Cardiolipin (aCL) Antibodies:** Directed against cardiolipin.<br>- **Anti-β2-Glycoprotein I (Anti-β2GPI) Antibodies:** Directed against β2-glycoprotein I. This is the **most specific** antibody for APS, with a specificity of 97%.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Diagnosis**        | - **Suspicion:** Strongly suspect APS in patients <55 years with unprovoked thrombosis, stroke, or pregnancy morbidity.<br>- **Revised Sapporo Criteria:** Diagnosis requires at least 1 clinical criterion (vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity) AND at least 1 laboratory criterion (LA, aCL, or anti-β2GPI) confirmed on two occasions at least 12 weeks apart.<br>- **ACR/EULAR 2023 Criteria:** A new weighted scoring system. A patient is classified with APS if they score ≥3 points in the clinical domain and ≥3 points in the laboratory domain.                                                     |
| **Management**       | - **High-Risk Profile:** Defined by presence of LA, double/triple antibody positivity, or persistently high titers.<br>- **Asymptomatic High-Risk:** Treat with low-dose aspirin (LDA) 75-100 mg/day.<br>- **Obstetric APS (History of pregnancy loss only):** During pregnancy, treat with LDA + prophylactic heparin. Continue heparin for 6 weeks postpartum.<br>- **Thrombotic APS (History of thrombosis):** Lifelong anticoagulation with a Vitamin K Antagonist (Warfarin) to a target INR of 2.0-3.0. For recurrent events, consider adding LDA or increasing the INR target to 3.0-4.0. |

### CHAPTER 365: INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES

**OVERVIEW AND DIAGNOSIS**
*   Inflammatory myopathies are a group of diseases characterized by progressive and symmetric proximal muscle weakness, which is initially painful. Sensory function is preserved.
*   **Five Types:** Dermatomyositis (DM), Polymyositis (PM), Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), Antisynthetase syndrome (AS), and Inclusion body myositis (IBM).
*   **Diagnostic Modalities:**
    *   **Serum Creatine Kinase (CK):** The most sensitive lab marker of muscle destruction.
    *   **EMG/NCS:** Helps localize the lesion to the muscle and guides biopsy.
    *   **Myositis-Specific Antibodies (MSAs):** Help distinguish between the different subtypes.
    *   **Muscle MRI:** Assesses the extent of muscle involvement and guides biopsy.
    *   **Muscle Biopsy:** The definitive diagnostic modality.

**TYPES OF INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES**

| Type                | Key Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Polymyositis (PM)** | - Presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness with **NO RASH**.<br>- It is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out drug-induced, infectious, and metabolic causes.<br>- **Histopathology:** Shows inflammatory cell infiltrates (CD8+ T cells, macrophages) in the **endomysium**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Dermatomyositis (DM)** | - Presents as polymyositis **WITH A RASH**.<br>- It is **highly associated with malignancy*** (ovarian, breast, colon, etc.), with a 15% risk within 3 years of onset.<br>- **Pathognomonic Rashes***: <br>    - **Heliotrope rash:** Erythematous discoloration of eyelids.<br>    - **Gottron's sign/papules:** Erythematous rash over the extensor surfaces of joints, especially the knuckles.<br>    - **V sign** (chest) and **Shawl sign** (back/shoulders).<br>- **Key MSAs:** `Anti-TIF1` & `Anti-NXP2` (increased cancer risk), `Anti-MDA5` (amyopathic DM, ILD), `Anti-Mi-2` (benign course).<br>- **Histopathology:** Shows inflammatory infiltrates in the **perimysium** and **perivascular areas**, with **perifascicular atrophy**. MxA protein staining is highly specific. |
| **Antisynthetase Syndrome (AS)** | - A subtype of DM characterized by myositis, nonerosive arthritis, ILD, Raynaud's phenomenon, fever, and **mechanic's hands*** (rough, cracked skin on fingers).<br>- It does **not** increase the risk for malignancy.<br>- **Antibody:** Presence of antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, most commonly **Anti-Jo-1**.<br>- **Histopathology:** Like DM with perimysial damage, but with more muscle fiber **necrosis** than perifascicular atrophy. |
| **Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM)** | - A severe myopathy, often difficult to treat.<br>- Characterized by two specific autoantibodies:<br>    - **Anti-HMGCR:** Associated with statin-induced myopathy that does not improve after discontinuing the statin. Carries an increased risk of malignancy.<br>    - **Anti-SRP**.<br>- **Histopathology:** Shows multifocal necrotic and regenerating muscle fibers with a **paucity of inflammatory cells**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)** | - The most common myopathy in individuals aged >50.<br>- Presents with slowly progressive, **asymmetric muscle weakness** that may start **distally** (wrist/finger flexors and quadriceps).<br>- Responds poorly to treatment and has a poor prognosis.<br>- **Antibody:** `Anti-cN-1A` is a highly specific diagnostic marker.***<br>- **Histopathology:** Shows **endomysial** inflammation (like PM) but is distinguished by the presence of **rimmed vacuoles** and amyloid deposits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES**
*   **First-line:** Steroids are the standard treatment for inflammatory myopathies.
*   **Second-line:** Steroid-sparing agents like `Methotrexate` (preferred), `Azathioprine`, or `Mycophenolate` (preferred for ILD) are used for severe disease or to taper steroids.
*   **Refractory Disease:** IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG) or `Rituximab` may be used.
*   **IMNM:** Requires steroids plus a second-line agent from the start.
*   **IBM:** Often does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy; the main therapy is Physical and Occupational Therapy (PT/OT).
*   **Monitoring:** Treatment adjustments should be based on objective improvement in muscle strength, not just on CK levels.
*   **Steroid Myopathy:** If weakness develops on high-dose steroids with a normal CK level, it may be steroid-induced myopathy rather than a disease relapse.

| **Definition & Epidemiology** | - A chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocyte infiltration of exocrine glands (especially lacrimal and salivary) and B-cell hyperactivity.<br>- Primarily affects middle-aged women (Female:Male ratio of 10-20:1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Pathogenesis**              | - Involves T-cell and B-cell infiltration of glands, leading to apoptosis of glandular epithelial cells.<br>- **Key Autoantibodies***: `Anti-Ro/SS-A` and `Anti-La/SS-B`. Their presence is associated with earlier onset and more severe disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS & DIFFERENTIATORS

1.  **SLE Arthritis vs. RA Arthritis:** Both can present in young women with symmetric polyarthritis of the hands. However, SLE arthritis is **rarely erosive**, while RA is classically erosive and deforming.
2.  **SLE Mucosal Ulcers:** **Oral ulcers** are painless and do **NOT** correlate with disease activity, whereas **Nasal ulcers** (on the lower septum) **ARE** associated with disease activity.
3.  **SLE-Specific Antibodies:** `Anti-dsDNA` is specific for SLE and its levels often **correlate with disease activity** (especially nephritis). `Anti-Sm` is also highly specific for SLE but its levels do **not** correlate with disease activity.
4.  **SLE Cutaneous Rashes:**
    *   **Malar Rash (Acute):** Erythematous rash on cheeks, **spares nasolabial folds**, non-scarring.
    *   **Subacute Cutaneous Lupus (SCLE):** Photosensitive annular or psoriasiform rashes, **spares the face**, non-scarring, associated with anti-Ro.
    *   **Discoid Lupus (DLE) (Chronic):** Circular, atrophic, hyperpigmented lesions that **cause scarring and disfigurement**.
5.  **Polymyositis vs. Dermatomyositis:** The key differentiator is the **rash**. DM has pathognomonic rashes (Heliotrope, Gottron's) and is highly associated with malignancy. PM has no rash. Histologically, PM has **endomysial** infiltrates, while DM has **perimysial** infiltrates and **perifascicular atrophy**.
6.  **Polymyositis vs. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM):** Both show **endomysial** inflammation on biopsy. However, IBM occurs in older men (>50), causes **asymmetric and distal** weakness (finger flexors), has **rimmed vacuoles** on biopsy, is associated with the `anti-cN-1A` antibody, and responds poorly to treatment.
7.  **Dermatomyositis vs. Antisynthetase Syndrome (AS):** AS is a subtype of DM. Differentiators for AS are the triad of myositis, ILD, and non-erosive arthritis, plus the presence of **mechanic's hands** and **anti-synthetase antibodies (e.g., anti-Jo-1)**. Importantly, AS does **not** carry the increased malignancy risk seen in classic DM.
8.  **SLE vs. Sjögren's Syndrome:** Both are autoimmune, affect women, and can have positive anti-Ro/La. SLE is a systemic disease with prominent features like nephritis and malar rash. Sjögren's is defined by **sicca symptoms** (dry eyes/mouth) from exocrine gland destruction and carries a significant risk of **lymphoma**.
9.  **SLE Hematologic Findings:** SLE is unique among many connective tissue diseases for causing **leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia**. Other inflammatory conditions often cause leukocytosis.
10. **Lupus Nephritis Induction Meds:** For fertility concerns, **Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)** is preferred over **Cyclophosphamide**, which carries a high risk of permanent ovarian failure.
11. **Life-Threatening vs. Non-Life-Threatening SLE:** Treatment differs drastically. Non-life-threatening disease (skin, joints) is managed with NSAIDs, Hydroxychloroquine, and low-dose steroids. Life-threatening disease (renal, CNS, cardiac, severe hematologic) requires **high-dose glucocorticoids and potent immunosuppressants**.
12. **Antiphospholipid Antibodies:** `Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)` is the strongest predictor of thrombosis. `Anti-β2-Glycoprotein I` is the most specific antibody for APS diagnosis (97% specificity). Positive lab tests must be confirmed **≥12 weeks apart** to be diagnostically significant.
13. **Relapse of Myositis vs. Steroid Myopathy:** Both cause weakness. A myositis relapse is typically associated with a **rising CK level**. Steroid-induced myopathy occurs on high-dose steroids and is characterized by a **normal CK level**.

### CHAPTER 363: THE VASCULITIS SYNDROMES

#### I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

*   **Definition of Vasculitis:** Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, which compromises the vessel lumen and leads to ischemia of the tissues it supplies.
*   **Primary vs. Secondary Vasculitis:** Primary vasculitis is when vasculitis is the sole disease manifestation. Secondary vasculitis occurs as part of another underlying disease (e.g., Hepatitis C, HIV).
*   **Constitutional Signs/Symptoms of Vasculitis:** Common features of inflammation include fever, elevated ESR/CRP, anemia (of chronic disease or from bleeding), leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis.
*   **Diagnosis of Vasculitis:** A tissue biopsy provides the definitive diagnosis. An arteriogram is used for medium- to large-vessel vasculitis if a biopsy cannot be done. It is crucial to rule out other diseases that can mimic vasculitis.
*   **General Signs/Symptoms Suggestive of Vasculitis:** Systemic symptoms (malaise, fever, weight loss), respiratory symptoms (cough, hemoptysis), skin changes (purpura, ulcers), ENT issues (epistaxis, sinusitis), GI pain, and neurologic deficits are common but vague.

#### II. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

*   **Immune-Mediated Pathogenesis:** Most vasculitides are immune-mediated, resulting from a complex interaction between genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and immune regulatory mechanisms.
*   **Three Main Pathophysiologic Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Pathogenic Immune-Complex Formation:** Antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., in Hepatitis B-associated PAN, Hepatitis C-associated cryoglobulinemia) deposit in vessel walls, activating complement and causing neutrophil-mediated damage.
    2.  **Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) Production:** Autoantibodies target neutrophil proteins (PR3, MPO), causing neutrophil activation and endothelial injury, leading to small-vessel vasculitis.
    3.  **Pathogenic T-Lymphocyte Responses & Granuloma Formation:** T-cells are activated and, along with macrophages, infiltrate the vessel wall, leading to inflammation and granuloma formation.

#### III. ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES (ANCA)

*   **ANCA Definition:** ANCAs are autoantibodies directed against proteins in the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils and monocytes.
*   **Cytoplasmic ANCA (cANCA):** cANCA is directed against **serine proteinase (PR3)** and is highly associated with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).
*   **Perinuclear ANCA (pANCA):** pANCA is directed against **myeloperoxidase (MPO)** and is associated with Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) and Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA).
*   **Non-MPO/PR3 ANCA:** Other antigens can cause ANCA positivity (e.g., in RA, SLE, certain drugs), but these are considered false-positives for ANCA-associated vasculitis and do not cause vasculitis. Positive tests must be confirmed for PR3 or MPO specificity.
*   **Clinical Usefulness of ANCA:** ANCAs are **not** part of the diagnostic criteria but have high diagnostic potential. Titers do not always correlate with disease activity, so treatment decisions are based on clinical findings.

| ANCA-Associated Vasculitis | ANCA Positivity | Predominant ANCA Type      |
| :------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- |
| **GPA (Wegener's)**        | 80-95%          | ~90% **cANCA (anti-PR3)**  |
| **MPA**                    | ~70%            | ~70% **pANCA (anti-MPO)**  |
| **EGPA (Churg-Strauss)**   | ~50%            | ~40% **pANCA (anti-MPO)**  |

#### IV. VASCULITIS CLASSIFICATION BY VESSEL SIZE & CLINICAL CLUES

| Vessel Size   | Associated Diseases                                                                                                   | Clinical Clues                                                    |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large Vessel**  | Giant Cell (Temporal) Arteritis, Takayasu’s Arteritis                                                                 | Claudication, asymmetric pulses, blood pressure discrepancies.    |
| **Medium Vessel** | Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN), Kawasaki Disease                                                                          | Livedo reticularis, digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, abdominal pain. |

### SMALL VESSEL VASCULITIS

#### A. GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (GPA / WEGENER'S)

*   **Hallmarks:** GPA is a **granulomatous vasculitis** of the **upper and lower respiratory tracts** combined with **glomerulonephritis.**
*   **Pathology:** The key feature is **necrotizing granulomatous inflammation** of small arteries and veins. Chronic nasal carriage of *S. aureus* is associated with higher relapse rates.
*   **Clinical - Upper Respiratory Tract (95%):** Sinus pain, purulent/bloody nasal discharge, nasal septal perforation leading to **saddle nose deformity**, and subglottic tracheal stenosis are characteristic.
*   **Clinical - Lung (85-90%):** Manifestations range from asymptomatic infiltrates to cough and hemoptysis. Chest imaging often shows multiple, bilateral, **nodular cavitary infiltrates.**
*   **Clinical - Kidney (77%):** Rapidly progressive, crescentic glomerulonephritis is common.
*   **Clinical - Other:** Eye involvement (retroorbital mass, scleritis), skin lesions (palpable purpura), and an increased incidence of venous thrombosis can occur.
*   **Diagnosis:** The definitive diagnosis is made by **tissue biopsy demonstrating necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis.** Pulmonary tissue provides the highest diagnostic yield.
*   **Lab Findings:** **Anti-PR3 ANCA (cANCA)** is highly specific for GPA (~90% of active cases). Elevated ESR/CRP and thrombocytosis are also seen.
*   **Treatment (Severe Disease):** Induction therapy involves high-dose glucocorticoids plus either **Rituximab** or **Cyclophosphamide.** This is followed by maintenance therapy with agents like Rituximab, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate.

#### B. MICROSCOPIC POLYANGIITIS (MPA)

*   **Hallmarks:** MPA is a **necrotizing** pauci-immune vasculitis of small vessels (capillaries, venules) that **lacks granulomatous inflammation.**
*   **Key Differentiator from GPA:** The primary distinction from GPA is the **absence of granulomas** and the **absence of significant upper airway disease.**
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage are very common.
*   **Diagnosis & Treatment:** Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy showing non-granulomatous, pauci-immune vasculitis. Treatment is the same as for severe GPA.

#### C. EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (EGPA / CHURG-STRAUSS)

*   **Hallmarks:** EGPA is characterized by **asthma, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia,** and extravascular **granuloma formation.**
*   **Pathology:** Histology shows granulomatous inflammation with prominent eosinophilic infiltration of tissues. The classic triad is **Asthma + Eosinophilia + Necrotizing Granulomatous Vasculitis.**
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Pulmonary findings dominate, especially **severe asthmatic attacks.** Allergic rhinitis is common. **Mononeuritis multiplex** is the second most common manifestation. Cardiac involvement is a major cause of mortality. Kidney involvement is less common and less severe than in GPA or MPA.
*   **Lab Findings:** The hallmark is marked **eosinophilia** (>1000 cells/µL). **p-ANCA (anti-MPO)** is present in about half of patients.
*   **Diagnosis & Treatment:** Diagnosis is based on clinical features (asthma, eosinophilia) and confirmed by biopsy. First-line treatment is systemic glucocorticoids. For severe disease, Cyclophosphamide is used. **Mepolizumab (anti-IL-5)** is effective for relapsing disease.

#### D. IgA VASCULITIS (HENOCH-SCHÖNLEIN PURPURA / HSP)

*   **Hallmarks:** Often triggered by an upper respiratory tract infection, IgA vasculitis typically affects children.
*   **Pathology:** Caused by the deposition of **IgA-containing immune complexes** in small vessels.
*   **Clinical Triad:** The classic presentation includes **1) Palpable purpura** on dependent areas (legs, buttocks), **2) Abdominal pain,** and **3) Polyarthralgia.**
*   **Renal Involvement:** Glomerulonephritis can occur and is the main determinant of long-term prognosis, especially in adults.
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is clinical, based on the classic triad. A biopsy of the skin or kidney will show **IgA and C3 deposition.** Platelet count and complement levels are typically normal.
*   **Treatment:** Mostly supportive. Glucocorticoids are used to relieve severe abdominal and joint pain but do not prevent renal disease. Immunosuppressants are used for severe renal disease.

#### E. IDIOPATHIC CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS

*   **Hallmarks:** Also known as hypersensitivity vasculitis or cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, this is inflammation confined to the blood vessels of the dermis, with no systemic organ involvement.
*   **Pathology:** A **leukocytoclastic vasculitis** (nuclear debris from neutrophils) primarily affecting postcapillary venules.
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Presents only with skin lesions, most commonly palpable purpura, but can also be urticaria, vesicles, or ulcers.
*   **Diagnosis & Treatment:** Diagnosis is by skin biopsy. Treatment involves identifying and removing the inciting agent (e.g., drug, infection). Idiopathic cases may resolve spontaneously or require steroids.

---

### MEDIUM VESSEL VASCULITIS

#### A. POLYARTERITIS NODOSA (PAN)

*   **Hallmarks:** PAN is a necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium-sized **arteries**, sparing venules. It does **not** involve pulmonary arteries and is **not** associated with ANCA.
*   **Associations:** About 30% of cases were historically associated with **Hepatitis B** infection. It can also be linked to Hepatitis C.
*   **Pathology:** A key feature is the formation of **aneurysmal dilations** along the arteries, which can be seen on arteriogram ("beads on a string" or "rosary sign"). Histology shows necrotizing inflammation without granulomas.
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Symptoms depend on the organs affected (renal, visceral arteries). Renal involvement causes renovascular **hypertension** due to glomerulosclerosis, not glomerulonephritis. Patients may present with abdominal pain, skin nodules, or mononeuritis multiplex.
*   **Diagnosis:** The gold standard is a **biopsy** of an affected organ (skin, nerve, muscle). An **arteriogram** showing aneurysms and stenosis in renal, hepatic, or visceral vessels is also diagnostic.
*   **Treatment:** High-dose glucocorticoids. Cyclophosphamide is added for severe, refractory disease.

---

### LARGE VESSEL VASCULITIS

#### A. GIANT CELL ARTERITIS (GCA) & POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (PMR)

*   **Hallmarks:** GCA is a vasculitis of large and medium vessels, typically the **carotid artery and its branches (especially the temporal artery).** It almost exclusively affects individuals **> 50 years old.**
*   **Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR):** A related syndrome causing stiffness, aching, and pain in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and hips. Occurs in ~50% of GCA patients.
*   **Pathology:** Histology shows mononuclear cell infiltrates within the vessel wall with **giant cell formation.**
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** The predominant symptom is a **new-onset headache.** The temporal artery may be tender, thickened, or nodular. **Jaw claudication** is highly specific. The most dreaded complication is **ischemic optic neuropathy**, which can cause sudden blindness.
*   **Diagnosis:** The gold standard for GCA is a **biopsy of the temporal artery.** For isolated PMR, diagnosis is clinical (age >50, typical symptoms, elevated ESR/CRP, and prompt response to low-dose steroids).
*   **Treatment:** GCA is a medical emergency requiring immediate high-dose glucocorticoids to prevent blindness. **Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6)** is used for refractory disease. PMR is treated with low-dose steroids.

#### B. TAKAYASU’S ARTERITIS

*   **Hallmarks:** TA is an inflammatory and stenotic disease of the aorta and its main branches, affecting **young women** (typically < 50 years old). It is also known as "pulseless disease."
*   **Pathology:** It is a panarteritis with a strong predilection for the **aortic arch and its branches,** with the **subclavian artery** being most commonly involved.
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Early systemic symptoms include fever, malaise, and weight loss. Later vascular symptoms include **arm claudication, blood pressure discrepancies** between arms, absent or weak peripheral pulses, and arterial bruits.
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is suspected in a young woman with characteristic vascular signs and confirmed by **arteriography (CTA/MRA)** showing stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysms of the aorta and its branches.
*   **Treatment:** Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy. Surgical or endovascular procedures may be needed for critical stenosis after inflammation is controlled.

---

### CHAPTER 359: ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER (ARF)

#### I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

*   **Definition:** ARF is a multi-system, nonsuppurative inflammatory disease that is an **immune-mediated sequela of a Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis.** It is not an active infection.
*   **Epidemiology:** ARF is a disease of poverty, mainly affecting children **aged 5-15 years.**
*   **Etiology:** Caused by a throat infection with certain rheumatogenic M protein strains of *S. pyogenes* (Group A Strep).
*   **Pathogenesis:** The mechanism is **molecular mimicry,** where antibodies and T-cells directed against streptococcal antigens cross-react with human tissues (heart, joints, CNS).
*   **Latency Period:** There is a latent period of **~3 weeks** between the GAS pharyngitis and the onset of ARF symptoms. Chorea may have a much longer latency period (up to 6 months).

#### II. CLINICAL FEATURES & DIAGNOSIS (REVISED JONES CRITERIA)

*   **Diagnosis:** Requires evidence of a preceding GAS infection (e.g., positive throat swab, rapid antigen test, or elevated ASO/anti-DNase B titers) plus a combination of major and minor criteria.
*   **Echocardiography:** Recommended in all suspected cases to detect valvular regurgitation and identify subclinical carditis.

| Major Manifestations                | Minor Manifestations                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C**arditis (endo-, myo-, pericarditis) | **P**olyarthralgia                                          |
| **A**rthritis (migratory polyarthritis) | **E**levated ESR (≥60 mm/h) or CRP (≥3.0 mg/dL)             |
| **N**odules (subcutaneous)              | **F**ever (≥38.5°C)                                         |
| **C**horea (Sydenham)                   | **P**R interval prolongation on ECG                          |
| **ER**ythema Marginatum               |                                                             |
| *Mnemonic: **CANCER***               | *Mnemonic: **PEF-P***                                       |

*   **Carditis (50-75%):** The most serious manifestation, potentially causing permanent damage (Rheumatic Heart Disease). It is a pancarditis. The **mitral valve** is almost always affected, leading to regurgitation.
*   **Polyarthritis (60–75%):** A **migratory** arthritis affecting large joints (knees, ankles). It is typically very painful but shows a **dramatic response to salicylates.** If joint pain persists >2 days after starting NSAIDs, ARF is unlikely.
*   **Sydenham Chorea:** A delayed neurologic manifestation with involuntary, purposeless movements, often associated with emotional lability. More common in females.
*   **Erythema Marginatum (<5%):** A pink, macular rash with serpiginous, spreading edges, typically on the trunk and limbs. It is evanescent (comes and goes).
*   **Subcutaneous Nodules (<5%):** Painless, mobile lumps over bony prominences. Associated with severe carditis.

#### III. TREATMENT & PROPHYLAXIS

*   **Acute Management:**
    1.  **Eradicate GAS:** A single dose of intramuscular **Benzathine Penicillin G** or a 10-day course of oral penicillin. This is given even if the throat swab is negative.
    2.  **Anti-inflammatory Therapy:**
        *   **Aspirin/NSAIDs** for arthritis and fever.
        *   **Corticosteroids** are reserved for patients with severe carditis (heart failure).
    3.  **Supportive Care:** Bed rest is advised during active carditis.
*   **Secondary Prophylaxis:** The cornerstone of preventing RHD is long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent GAS infections. **Intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G every 3-4 weeks** is the preferred regimen.
*   **Duration of Secondary Prophylaxis:**
    *   **ARF without Carditis:** 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer).
    *   **ARF with Carditis but NO residual heart disease:** 10 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer).
    *   **ARF with Carditis AND residual heart disease:** 10 years or until age 40 (whichever is longer), and potentially lifelong for severe valvular disease.
*   **Complications:** The primary long-term complication is **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD),** leading to chronic valvular stenosis or regurgitation, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

---

### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS

*   **GPA vs. MPA:** GPA has **granulomas** and significant **upper respiratory tract** involvement (sinusitis, saddle nose); MPA lacks both of these features. GPA is typically **c-ANCA (PR3)** positive, while MPA is **p-ANCA (MPO)** positive.
*   **ANCA Vasculitides vs. PAN:** ANCA-associated vasculitides (GPA, MPA, EGPA) are ANCA-positive. Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) is **ANCA-negative**. PAN affects arteries only, while MPA can affect venules.
*   **EGPA vs. Other AAVs:** EGPA (Churg-Strauss) is distinguished by the presence of **asthma** and profound peripheral **eosinophilia**, which are absent in GPA and MPA.
*   **Giant Cell Arteritis vs. Takayasu's Arteritis:** Both are large-vessel vasculitides, but GCA affects patients **>50 years old**, while Takayasu's affects patients **<50 years old** (typically young women).
*   **PAN vs. IgA Vasculitis:** PAN is a necrotizing arteritis of medium vessels without significant immune deposits, often presenting with visceral ischemia. IgA vasculitis is a small-vessel vasculitis caused by IgA deposition, classically presenting with palpable purpura, arthralgia, and abdominal pain.
*   **ARF Arthritis vs. Rheumatoid Arthritis:** ARF arthritis is **migratory**, moving from joint to joint, and has a dramatic, rapid response to salicylates. RA is typically a symmetric, persistent, and erosive arthritis.
*   **GPA Pulmonary Nodules vs. Other Causes:** The lung nodules in GPA are characteristically **cavitary**.
*   **Vasculitic Glomerulonephritis vs. PAN Renal Disease:** ANCA vasculitides and IgA vasculitis cause an active, inflammatory glomerulonephritis (GN) with an active urine sediment. PAN causes renal artery stenosis and ischemia, leading to renovascular **hypertension** and glomerulosclerosis, not typically a true GN.
*   **c-ANCA vs. p-ANCA:** c-ANCA targets **PR3** and is highly specific for **GPA**. p-ANCA targets **MPO** and is most commonly seen in **MPA** and **EGPA**.
*   **Diagnosis: Biopsy vs. Arteriogram:** **Biopsy** is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis in most vasculitides (especially small-vessel). An **arteriogram (CTA/MRA)** is the diagnostic modality of choice for large-vessel vasculitides (Takayasu's) and can be diagnostic in PAN by showing characteristic aneurysms.
*   **GPA, MPA, EGPA Histology:** GPA shows **necrotizing granulomas**. MPA shows necrotizing vasculitis with **no granulomas**. EGPA shows necrotizing vasculitis with **eosinophil-rich granulomas**.
*   **Treatment: Rituximab vs. Cyclophosphamide:** Both are used for induction in severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. Rituximab is often preferred to preserve fertility compared to Cyclophosphamide.
*   **ARF Primary vs. Secondary Prophylaxis:** Primary prophylaxis is treating an acute GAS pharyngitis to prevent a first episode of ARF. Secondary prophylaxis is long-term antibiotic use in a patient who has already had ARF to prevent recurrences and the development of RHD.

### CHAPTER 360: SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SCLERODERMA) AND RELATED DISORDERS

#### I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES & DEFINITION
*   **Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) Definition:** Systemic Sclerosis is a multisystem connective tissue disease characterized by chronic inflammation, variable degrees of collagen accumulation (fibrosis), and obliterative vasculopathy affecting the skin and internal organs.
*   **Pathogenesis Hallmark:** The hallmark of Systemic Sclerosis pathogenesis is prominent microangiopathy in multiple vascular beds.
*   **Key Pathophysiologic Processes in SSc:** The pathogenesis of SSc involves three core processes: (1) Diffuse microangiopathy, (2) Inflammation and autoimmunity, and (3) Fibrosis of vascular and visceral tissues.
*   **Pathogenesis Summary:** In SSc, endothelial damage leads to chronic vasoconstriction and luminal narrowing. This stimulates an ongoing immune response (T-cells, B-cells) and the release of growth factors (TGF-β, PDGF), causing fibroblasts to become myofibroblasts. These myofibroblasts produce excessive collagen and extracellular matrix, leading to tissue fibrosis and organ failure.

#### II. ETIOLOGY & RISK FACTORS
*   **Etiology of SSc:** The cause of SSc is multifactorial, resulting from an interplay of genetic predisposition, epigenetic factors, infectious agents, and environmental exposures.
*   **Genetic Predisposition in SSc:** SSc is associated with HLA class II genes on chromosome 6.
*   **Infectious Agents Associated with SSc:** Potential infectious triggers for SSc include Parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Cytomegalovirus (CMV).
*   **Environmental & Drug Exposures in SSc:** Occupational exposure to silica (quartz) is a well-documented risk factor. Other associations include gadolinium contrast (nephrogenic fibrosis), polyvinyl chloride, welding fumes, and certain drugs like bleomycin and cocaine.

#### III. CLASSIFICATION OF SCLERODERMA
*   **Main Classifications:** Scleroderma is broadly classified into Localized Scleroderma and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).
*   **Localized Scleroderma:** A form of scleroderma that affects only the skin without internal organ involvement.
    *   **Morphea:** A type of localized scleroderma presenting as single or multiple plaques of hardened skin, typically on the trunk.
    *   **Linear Scleroderma:** A type of localized scleroderma presenting as bands of skin thickening on the legs, arms, or face. A facial presentation is termed "en coup de sabre."
*   **Systemic Sclerosis (SSc):** A form of scleroderma involving the skin and internal organs, further divided into limited and diffuse types.
*   **Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (lcSSc):**
    *   Skin thickening is restricted to areas distal to the elbows and knees, but may also involve the face and neck.
    *   Often associated with CREST syndrome manifestations: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia.
    *   Note: Limited SSc is not necessarily "mild" scleroderma and can have severe internal organ involvement like Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
*   **Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc):**
    *   Characterized by skin thickening that involves proximal limbs (above elbows/knees) and/or the trunk.
    *   Associated with a higher risk of early and significant internal organ disease (e.g., ILD, renal crisis) and poorer survival.
*   **SSc Sine Scleroderma:** A rare variant where patients have typical internal organ manifestations and autoantibodies of SSc but lack clinically evident skin thickening.

#### IV. CLINICAL FEATURES OF SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS

**A. General & Skin Manifestations**
*   **Skin Thickening:** The hallmark skin finding is bilateral, symmetric skin thickening and induration, making the skin difficult to pinch.
*   **"Salt and Pepper" Appearance:** A characteristic skin change in SSc involving interspersed areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation.
*   **Mauskopf Facie:** A "mouse-like" facial appearance due to skin tightening, resulting in a pinched nose, thin lips, prominent teeth, and an expressionless face.
*   **Sclerodactyly:** Thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers and/or toes.
*   **Other Skin Findings:** Dermal sclerosis can obliterate hair follicles and glands, leading to dryness (xerosis) and itching. Telangiectasias (dilated capillaries) are also common.

**B. Vascular Manifestations**
*   **Raynaud's Phenomenon:** The most common initial symptom, characterized by episodic vasoconstriction in digits, nose, or earlobes triggered by cold or stress.
*   **Triphasic Color Change of Raynaud's:** The classic sequence is (1) Pallor (white) from vasoconstriction, followed by (2) Cyanosis (blue) from ischemia, and then (3) Hyperemia (red) from reperfusion.
*   **Complications of Chronic Raynaud's:** Chronic, severe Raynaud's can lead to digital pitting scars, ulcers, dissolution (resorption) of distal phalanges, and dystrophic calcification (calcinosis cutis).
*   **Calcinosis Cutis:** The formation of calcium phosphate crystals, often in the soft tissues of the fingers or over bony prominences, associated with chronic disease.

**C. Gastrointestinal Manifestations**
*   **GI Involvement:** Gut dysmotility is the most common GI issue and can affect any segment of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus.
*   **Esophageal Dysfunction:** The most frequent GI manifestation, leading to chronic GERD, dysphagia, and risk of Barrett’s esophagus.
*   **Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE):** Also known as "watermelon stomach," this condition involves dilated blood vessels in the stomach that can lead to chronic GI bleeding and microcytic anemia.
*   **Small Bowel Involvement:** Hypomotility of the small bowel can cause bacterial overgrowth, leading to bloating, malabsorption, and macrocytic anemia (B12/folate deficiency). Wide-mouth diverticula can also form.
*   **Prognostic Factor:** Severe dysfunction of the lower GI tract in SSc is associated with a poor overall prognosis.

**D. Pulmonary Manifestations**
*   **Main Pulmonary Complications:** Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) are the leading causes of mortality in SSc.
*   **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) in SSc:** Characterized by fibrosis and scarring of the lung parenchyma, often showing a "honeycombing" pattern on high-resolution CT (HRCT). Highest risk is associated with a positive Anti-Scl-70 antibody.
*   **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in SSc:** Defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥20 mmHg at rest. It is a common complication, especially in Limited Cutaneous SSc.

**E. Renal Manifestations**
*   **Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC):** A life-threatening complication characterized by the abrupt onset of accelerated hypertension (>150/90 mmHg) and rapidly progressive renal failure.
*   **Risk Factors for SRC:** SRC typically occurs within the first 4 years of disease, is more common in diffuse SSc, and is strongly associated with a positive Anti-RNA Polymerase III antibody. High-dose corticosteroid use is a major precipitating factor.
*   **SRC Pathophysiology:** SRC is caused by microangiopathy in the kidney, leading to intimal proliferation of renal arterioles.
*   **Hallmark of SRC on Labs:** Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is a classic laboratory finding in SRC.

**F. Cardiovascular & Musculoskeletal Manifestations**
*   **Cardiac Involvement in SSc:** Can manifest as pericarditis, pericardial effusions, myocardial fibrosis (leading to heart failure), and fibrosis of the conduction system (leading to heart block and arrhythmias).
*   **Musculoskeletal Involvement in SSc:** Common features include arthralgia, morning stiffness, and prominent tendon friction rubs. Flexion contractures of the joints can develop due to skin thickening. An overlap with Rheumatoid Arthritis (erosive polyarthritis) can occur.

#### V. DIAGNOSIS
*   **Diagnostic Approach:** The diagnosis of SSc is primarily clinical, based on characteristic skin induration and visceral organ manifestations.
*   **ACR/EULAR 2013 Criteria:** A score of ≥9 establishes a definite diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis. Skin thickening of the fingers of both hands extending proximal to the MCP joints is sufficient for diagnosis (score = 9).
*   **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA):** ANA is positive in almost all patients with SSc, often in a nucleolar or speckled pattern.
*   **Scleroderma-Specific Antibodies:**
    *   **Anti-Scl-70 (Anti-topoisomerase I):** Highly specific for SSc, strongly associated with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and an increased risk for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD).
    *   **Anticentromere Antibody (ACA):** Highly specific for SSc, strongly associated with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and an increased risk for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
    *   **Anti-RNA Polymerase III Antibody:** Associated with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and a high risk for Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) and an increased risk of malignancy around the time of SSc onset.
*   **Anemia in SSc:**
    *   **Microcytic Anemia:** May result from chronic GI bleeding from GAVE or esophagitis.
    *   **Macrocytic Anemia:** May be caused by vitamin B12/folate deficiency from small-bowel bacterial overgrowth or as a side effect of methotrexate.
    *   **Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia:** A hallmark of Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC), caused by mechanical RBC fragmentation.
*   **Inflammatory Markers:** ESR and CRP are often normal in SSc. An elevated ESR may suggest a coexisting myositis or malignancy.

#### VI. TREATMENT & MANAGEMENT
*   **Treatment Goal:** There is no cure for SSc. Treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms, managing organ complications, and slowing disease progression.
*   **Role of Corticosteroids:** Glucocorticoids are used cautiously at low doses (<5-10 mg/day prednisone) for inflammatory arthritis or early inflammatory dcSSc. High doses are strongly associated with an increased risk of Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC).
*   **Irreversibility of Skin Changes:** It is important to note that established skin fibrosis and tightening are generally irreversible.

**A. Organ-Specific Treatment**
*   **Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) Management:**
    *   **First-line Treatment:** Prompt initiation of ACE inhibitors (e.g., Captopril, Enalapril) is critical and life-saving.
    *   **Goal:** The goal is to gradually lower blood pressure, not normalize it abruptly.
    *   **Refractory Cases:** May require adding ARBs, CCBs, or other agents. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) or kidney transplantation may be necessary.
*   **SSc-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Management:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring with HRCT scans and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) is essential.
    *   **Immunosuppressive Therapy:** Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or Cyclophosphamide are used to stabilize lung function.
    *   **Antifibrotic Therapy:** Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved to slow the rate of lung function decline in SSc-ILD.
*   **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Management:**
    *   **Treatment:** Requires advanced vasodilator therapies including endothelin-1 receptor antagonists (Bosentan), PDE-5 inhibitors (Sildenafil), and prostacyclin analogues (Epoprostenol).
*   **Gastrointestinal Complication Management:**
    *   **GERD:** Managed with PPIs, prokinetic agents, and lifestyle modifications (elevating head of bed, small frequent meals).
    *   **GAVE:** Bleeding is treated with endoscopic ablation (e.g., argon plasma coagulation).
    *   **Bacterial Overgrowth:** Treated with rotating courses of antibiotics.
    *   **Severe Hypomotility:** May require octreotide.
*   **Vascular / Raynaud's Phenomenon Management:**
    *   **First-line:** Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., Amlodipine, Nifedipine).
    *   **Advanced/Refractory:** Options include PDE-5 inhibitors (Sildenafil), ARBs (Losartan), or intermittent IV prostaglandins.
    *   **Digital Ulcers:** Bosentan can reduce the development of new ischemic ulcers. Low-dose aspirin is often used as an adjunctive agent.
*   **Skin & Joint Involvement Management:**
    *   **Joints:** Methotrexate can be used for SSc-associated arthritis.
    *   **Skin:** Methotrexate may provide modest benefit for early skin involvement. Cyclophosphamide may also improve skin induration.

**B. Advanced & Systemic Therapies**
*   **Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF):** Increasingly used as a first-line agent, showing benefits for both skin induration and ILD with a better safety profile than cyclophosphamide.
*   **Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6):** An biologic agent that has shown improvement in both skin and lung involvement in SSc.
*   **Rituximab (Anti-CD20):** Used in refractory cases with promising results for skin and lung disease.
*   **Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):** Reserved for patients with severe, rapidly progressive SSc; it is associated with significant treatment-related mortality but can induce long-term remission.

---
### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS

*   **Limited vs. Diffuse SSc:**
    *   **Limited (lcSSc):** Skin thickening distal to elbows/knees. Associated with Anticentromere antibody. Higher risk for late-onset Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
    *   **Diffuse (dcSSc):** Skin thickening includes proximal limbs/trunk. Associated with Anti-Scl-70 and Anti-RNA Pol III antibodies. Higher risk for early Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC).
*   **Anti-Scl-70 vs. Anticentromere vs. Anti-RNA Pol III:**
    *   **Anti-Scl-70 (Topoisomerase I):** Marker for Diffuse SSc and high risk of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD).
    *   **Anticentromere (ACA):** Marker for Limited SSc and high risk of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
    *   **Anti-RNA Polymerase III:** Marker for Diffuse SSc and high risk of Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) and malignancy.
*   **ILD vs. PAH in Scleroderma:**
    *   **ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease):** Fibrosis of lung tissue. Associated with Anti-Scl-70. Diagnosed with HRCT. Treated with immunosuppressants (MMF, Cyclophosphamide) and antifibrotics (Nintedanib).
    *   **PAH (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension):** High pressure in pulmonary arteries. Associated with Anticentromere. Diagnosed with right heart catheterization. Treated with vasodilators (Bosentan, Sildenafil).
*   **Localized vs. Systemic Scleroderma:**
    *   **Localized:** Involves only the skin (e.g., Morphea, Linear Scleroderma). No internal organ affectation.
    *   **Systemic:** Involves both the skin and internal organs (e.g., lungs, kidneys, GI tract).
*   **Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) vs. Other Hypertensive Emergencies:** SRC is uniquely characterized by accelerated hypertension combined with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the context of SSc. The first-line treatment is specifically ACE inhibitors.
*   **Scleroderma Raynaud's vs. Primary Raynaud's:** In SSc, nailfold capillaroscopy shows abnormal changes (capillary dilation, hemorrhage, and dropout), whereas in primary Raynaud's, the capillaries are normal.
*   **Role of Steroids in SSc vs. other CTDs (e.g., Lupus):** In SSc, steroids are used sparingly and at low doses due to the high risk of precipitating SRC. In active lupus, high-dose steroids are a cornerstone of treatment.
*   **Cyclophosphamide vs. Mycophenolate (MMF) for SSc-ILD:** Both are used for immunosuppression. Cyclophosphamide is effective but has higher toxicity (e.g., hemorrhagic cystitis, malignancy). MMF is now often preferred due to a better long-term safety profile.
*   **Nintedanib vs. PPIs in SSc Treatment:** Nintedanib is an antifibrotic drug specifically used to slow the progression of SSc-ILD. PPIs are used for symptomatic management of the very common GI complication of GERD.
*   **GAVE ("Watermelon Stomach") vs. Esophageal Dysmotility:** Both are GI issues in SSc. GAVE is a vascular problem in the stomach causing chronic bleeding (microcytic anemia). Esophageal dysmotility is a motility problem causing GERD and dysphagia.
*   **Three Anemias of SSc:**
    *   **Microcytic Anemia:** Caused by chronic iron loss from GI bleeding (GAVE, esophagitis).
    *   **Macrocytic Anemia:** Caused by malabsorption of Vitamin B12/Folate due to bacterial overgrowth.
    *   **Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia:** A specific finding caused by mechanical damage to RBCs in the setting of Scleroderma Renal Crisis.

## Summary
text
### CHAPTER 371: OSTEOARTHRITIS

**I. BACKGROUND & PATHOGENESIS**
*   Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and a leading cause of disability in the elderly.
*   The pathogenesis of Osteoarthritis is conceptualized as "Joint Failure," resulting from a combination of risk factors, an initiating event, and the failure of the joint's protective mechanisms.
*   The pathologic "sine qua non" (an essential condition) for a diagnosis of Osteoarthritis is the loss of hyaline articular cartilage.
*   In Osteoarthritis, damaged hyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage, which is not as tensile or effective.
*   Chondrocytes in articular cartilage are incapable of regenerating, meaning cartilage is a non-renewable tissue.
*   In the context of Osteoarthritis pathogenesis, strong muscles absorb load and stabilize joints; when athletic activity stops, muscle disuse leads to atrophy, increasing the load on cartilage and making prior asymptomatic damage painful.

**II. RISK FACTORS**
*   The two major categories of risk factors for Osteoarthritis are joint vulnerability (e.g., increased age, genetics) and joint loading (e.g., obesity, repeated joint use).
*   Age is the most potent risk factor for Osteoarthritis, with radiographic evidence being rare in individuals under 40 years old.
*   Obesity is a potent risk factor for the development of knee Osteoarthritis, and to a lesser extent, hip Osteoarthritis, primarily through increased joint loading.
*   Genetics plays a role in Osteoarthritis; a family history of nodular hand OA increases the risk for an individual by 50%.
*   Repetitive occupational tasks are a risk factor for Osteoarthritis; for example, farmers are at high risk for hip OA, while miners are at risk for knee and spine OA.
*   Commonly affected joints in Osteoarthritis include the cervical and lumbosacral spine, hip, knee, distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (DIPs/PIPs), and the base of the thumb (1st carpometacarpal).
*   Joints typically spared in Osteoarthritis include the wrist, elbow, and ankle; pain in these joints warrants consideration of a different diagnosis.

**III. CLINICAL FEATURES**
*   In early Osteoarthritis, pain is typically episodic and triggered by overuse of the joint.
*   As Osteoarthritis progresses, joint pain can become continuous, occur at rest, and even be nocturnal.
*   A key clinical feature of Osteoarthritis is brief morning stiffness, characteristically lasting less than 30 minutes, which helps distinguish it from inflammatory arthritis like Rheumatoid Arthritis.
*   Heberden's nodes are bony nodules found on the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in hand Osteoarthritis.
*   Bouchard's nodes are bony nodules found on the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints in hand Osteoarthritis.
*   Osteoarthritis of the 1st carpometacarpal joint at the base of the thumb should be considered in patients complaining of a stinging pain with pinching, gripping, or twisting objects.
*   A varus (bow-legged) deformity in a patient with knee pain suggests cartilage loss in the medial compartment of the knee due to Osteoarthritis.
*   A valgus (knock-knee) deformity in a patient with knee pain suggests cartilage loss in the lateral compartment of the knee due to Osteoarthritis.

**IV. DIAGNOSIS**
*   The diagnosis of Osteoarthritis is primarily made clinically, and routine blood tests are not usually needed.
*   If performed, synovial fluid analysis in Osteoarthritis shows non-inflammatory fluid, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of less than 2,000 cells/µL.
*   Imaging is not usually necessary for an initial diagnosis of Osteoarthritis and is often used to rule out other conditions like fractures.
*   The severity of pain in Osteoarthritis correlates poorly with radiographic findings, as the cartilage itself has no nerve supply.
*   The key radiographic findings in Osteoarthritis are:
    1.  Joint space narrowing (a surrogate for hyaline articular cartilage loss).
    2.  Subchondral thickness and sclerosis.
    3.  Osteophytes (bony outgrowths at joint margins).

**V. TREATMENT**
*   The main goals of Osteoarthritis treatment are to alleviate pain and minimize the loss of physical function.
*   Non-pharmacologic management is a cornerstone of Osteoarthritis treatment and includes patient education to avoid painful activities, weight loss, and exercise (aerobic and resistance training).
*   For Osteoarthritis, physical management includes unloading the affected joint through the use of a brace, splint, cane, or crutch.
*   First-line pharmacotherapy for Osteoarthritis is often Paracetamol due to its favorable side-effect profile when used at the appropriate dose.
*   NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are more effective than paracetamol for Osteoarthritis pain but are not recommended for daily use due to potential side effects.
*   Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections for Osteoarthritis offer short-term pain relief and are typically reserved for larger joints like the knee.
*   Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections for Osteoarthritis have a slower onset of action than corticosteroids but may provide longer-lasting relief.
*   Surgical options for severe Osteoarthritis include joint realignment or total joint arthroplasty (replacement) of the knee or hip.
*   There is currently no sufficient evidence to support cartilage regeneration techniques, including stem cell therapy, for the treatment of Osteoarthritis.

### CHAPTER 370/372: GOUT AND OTHER CRYSTAL-ASSOCIATED ARTHROPATHIES

**I. ACUTE MONOARTHRITIS & SEPTIC ARTHRITIS**
*   The primary differential diagnoses for an acute, red, hot, swollen joint (acute monoarthritis) are:
    1.  Crystal-induced arthritis (e.g., Gout).
    2.  Trauma (may cause hemarthrosis).
    3.  Septic arthritis.
*   Septic arthritis must be ruled out emergently in cases of acute monoarthritis, as irreversible joint damage can occur in less than 24-48 hours if left untreated.
*   Arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) is a critical diagnostic procedure for acute monoarthritis to analyze the synovial fluid.
*   In septic arthritis, the synovial fluid is typically purulent or turbid, with a very high WBC count (often >50,000/uL, >90% neutrophils), and a positive Gram stain and culture.
*   The most common causative agent for non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis is *Staphylococcus aureus*.
*   The knee is the most commonly involved joint in non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis, which typically presents as a monoarticular arthritis.
*   Risk factors for non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis include Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes Mellitus, use of glucocorticoids, and immunodeficiencies.
*   Gonococcal arthritis is more likely to occur in women, and may present as Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI) with fever, rash, and articular symptoms.
*   The recommended treatment for gonococcal arthritis is Ceftriaxone.
*   Poncet's disease is a reactive symmetric polyarthritis associated with an untreated *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection elsewhere in the body; the joint culture is negative.
*   Sporotrichosis is a fungal arthritis that can cause chronic, indolent monoarthritis, often seen in gardeners ("Rose gardener's disease").

**II. GOUT: PATHOPHYSIOLOGY & CLINICAL FEATURES**
*   Gout is a metabolic disease caused by chronic hyperuricemia leading to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in and around the joints.
*   The pathophysiology of an acute gout flare involves the shedding of MSU crystals into the joint, which triggers a potent inflammatory response from synovial macrophages and other cells.
*   Key risk factors for Gout include hyperuricemia, obesity, Western diet, alcohol consumption, and use of medications like diuretics (e.g., Furosemide) and low-dose aspirin.
*   A classic Gout attack presents as an intensely painful, warm, red, and swollen joint.
*   The first attack of Gout is usually monoarticular, with the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint being the most commonly affected site, a condition known as "podagra".

**III. GOUT: DIAGNOSIS**
*   The gold standard for diagnosing Gout is the identification of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid via polarized light microscopy.
*   Under a polarizing microscope with a first-order compensator, MSU crystals in Gout appear yellow when parallel to the axis of the compensator and blue when perpendicular.
*   During an acute Gout flare, serum uric acid (SUA) levels can be normal or even low due to cytokine-mediated uricosuria; levels should be rechecked 4-6 weeks after the flare resolves.
*   On ultrasound, MSU crystal deposition on the surface of cartilage can create a "double contour" sign, which can be seen even in asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients.
*   Radiographic findings in chronic Gout can include "rat-bite" erosions, which are punched-out erosions with sclerotic margins and overhanging edges.

**IV. GOUT: TREATMENT**
*   The treatment for an acute Gout attack focuses on anti-inflammatory therapy with NSAIDs, Colchicine, or glucocorticoids.
*   Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) such as Allopurinol or Febuxostat should **NOT** be initiated during an active Gout flare, as it can potentially worsen the attack.
*   Prophylaxis against Gout flares with low-dose Colchicine (0.5 mg OD) or low-dose NSAIDs is often started concurrently with the initiation of urate-lowering therapy.
*   The target serum uric acid (SUA) level for patients with Gout is typically <6 mg/dL.
*   For patients with tophaceous Gout (visible tophi), a lower SUA target of <5 mg/dL is recommended to promote tophi dissolution.
*   Indications for starting long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) include:
    1.  Two or more Gout flares per year.
    2.  Presence of tophi.
    3.  History of uric acid kidney stones.
    4.  Evidence of radiographic damage due to Gout.

**V. OTHER CRYSTAL-ASSOCIATED ARTHROPATHIES**
*   Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition (CPPD) disease can cause an acute inflammatory arthritis known as "pseudogout".
*   The definitive diagnosis of CPPD is made by identifying rhomboid or rod-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals in the synovial fluid.
*   CPPD most commonly affects the knee and can be precipitated by trauma, severe illness, or parathyroidectomy.
*   On imaging, CPPD is associated with chondrocalcinosis, which appears as punctate or linear radiodense deposits in cartilage.
*   Calcium Apatite Deposition Disease involves the deposition of basic calcium phosphate crystals, which are typically not visible on standard polarized light microscopy.
*   Calcium Apatite Deposition is associated with a destructive arthropathy of the shoulder known as "Milwaukee shoulder".
*   Calcium Oxalate Deposition Disease is a rare condition seen mainly in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.
*   The diagnosis of Calcium Oxalate Deposition Disease is confirmed by finding envelope-shaped or bipyramidal, strongly birefringent crystals in the synovial fluid.

### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS

*   **Osteoarthritis vs. Gout (Clinical Presentation):** In Osteoarthritis, pain is insidious and related to use, with morning stiffness lasting <30 minutes. In Gout, the onset of pain is acute, severe, and inflammatory, often waking the patient from sleep.
*   **Osteoarthritis vs. Septic Arthritis (Synovial Fluid):** Osteoarthritis fluid is non-inflammatory (WBC < 2,000/µL). Septic arthritis fluid is purulent and highly inflammatory (WBC > 50,000/µL, >90% neutrophils, positive culture).
*   **Gout vs. Pseudogout (Crystals):** Gout is caused by needle-shaped, *negatively* birefringent MSU crystals. Pseudogout (CPPD) is caused by rhomboid-shaped, *weakly positively* birefringent CPP crystals.
*   **Gout Crystal Birefringence (Color Rule):** In Gout, MSU crystals appear *Y*ellow when para*ll*el to the compensator axis and Blue when Perpendicular. (Mnemonic: Y-L-L for YeLLow-paraLLel).
*   **Pseudogout Crystal Birefringence (Color Rule):** In Pseudogout, CPP crystals appear Blue when Parallel to the compensator axis and Yellow when Perpendicular.
*   **Starting Urate-Lowering Therapy (ULT) in Gout:** ULT (e.g., Allopurinol) should *not* be started during an acute flare. The acute inflammation should be treated first, and ULT can be initiated once the flare has resolved, typically with prophylactic anti-inflammatory cover.
*   **Affected Joints in OA vs. Gout:** OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints (knees, hips) and hands (DIPs, PIPs). Gout's classic initial presentation is in the 1st MTP joint (podagra), but it can also affect the midfoot, ankles, and knees.
*   **Hand OA vs. Gout in Hands:** Hand OA presents as bony nodules (Heberden's/Bouchard's) at the DIP/PIP joints. Gout can also affect hand joints but presents as acute inflammatory attacks and can form tophi.
*   **Radiographic Findings in OA vs. Gout:** OA shows joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytes. Chronic Gout shows characteristic "rat-bite" or punched-out erosions with overhanging edges.
*   **Aspirin's Effect on Uric Acid:** Low-dose aspirin (<1-2 g/day) can increase serum uric acid levels by inhibiting renal tubular secretion and is a risk factor for Gout. High-dose aspirin has a uricosuric effect (lowers uric acid).
*   **Furosemide's Effect on Uric Acid:** Loop diuretics like furosemide increase uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to hyperuricemia and increasing the risk for Gout attacks.
*   **Non-gonococcal vs. Gonococcal Septic Arthritis:** Non-gonococcal arthritis is often a severe monoarthritis in an older patient with comorbidities (e.g., RA, DM), and fluid culture is usually positive. Gonococcal arthritis is more common in younger, sexually active individuals (especially women) and may present as a polyarthralgia/dermatitis syndrome (DGI) with less consistently positive cultures.
*   **Gout vs. CPPD vs. Calcium Oxalate (Key Associations):** Gout is associated with metabolic syndrome, alcohol, and diuretics. CPPD is associated with older age, hyperparathyroidism, and hemochromatosis. Calcium Oxalate arthritis is almost exclusively seen in patients with end-stage renal disease.
*   **Glucocorticoids in OA vs. Gout:** In OA, glucocorticoids are used via intra-articular injection for localized, short-term relief. In Gout, oral, intramuscular, or intra-articular glucocorticoids are a primary option for treating acute inflammatory flares.

## Summary
text
### CHAPTER 358: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA)

**I. INTRODUCTION & CLINICAL FEATURES**
*   Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis, characterized by systemic polyarthritis of unknown etiology.
*   The goal in Rheumatoid Arthritis is to diagnose and treat early before irreversible joint damage and functional disability ensue.
*   Rheumatoid Arthritis is more common in women than men, with an incidence that increases between 25 and 55 years of age.
*   A key clinical feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis is early morning stiffness lasting more than one hour, which improves with activity.
*   Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetrical joint pain and swelling, with a predilection for the small joints of the hands (MCPs, PIPs) and feet.
*   A frequent hallmark of Rheumatoid Arthritis is flexor tendon tenosynovitis.
*   The initial pattern of joint involvement in Rheumatoid Arthritis can be monoarticular, oligoarticular (≤ 4 joints), or polyarticular (> 5 joints), resulting from inflammation of joints, tendons, and bursae.

**II. PATHOGENESIS**
*   Genetic predisposition for Rheumatoid Arthritis is linked to MHC class II alleles, particularly HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DR4 related alleles.
*   Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated polypeptides (anti-CCP) are associated with the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.
*   Environmental factors that are risks for Rheumatoid Arthritis include cigarette smoking and infectious agents like *Porphyromonas gingivalis*.
*   The pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis involves CD4+ T-cell activation, which stimulates B cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts to secrete proinflammatory mediators like TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6.
*   In Rheumatoid Arthritis, TNF-α inhibits bone formation (via the Wnt pathway) and stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone destruction (via the RANKL pathway).

**III. MANIFESTATIONS**
*   **Chronic Hand Deformities in Rheumatoid Arthritis***:
    1.  **Swan neck deformity:** Characterized by hyperextension of the PIP joint and flexion of the DIP joint.
    2.  **Boutonniere deformity:** Characterized by flexion of the PIP joint and hyperextension of the DIP joint.
    3.  **Ulnar deviation:** A drift of the fingers toward the ulna at the MCP joints.
    4.  **MCP joint subluxation.**
    5.  **Intrinsic muscle atrophy:** Worsens and accentuates the deformities by removing dynamic joint stabilization.
*   Chronic hand deformities in Rheumatoid Arthritis require long-standing disease and are not typically seen in the early stages.
*   **Extra-Articular Manifestations of Rheumatoid Arthritis**:
    *   **Ocular:** Scleritis and secondary Sjogren’s syndrome (sicca syndrome).
    *   **Vascular:** Rheumatoid vasculitis, which can manifest as Livedo reticularis.
    *   **Dermatologic:** Rheumatoid nodules, seen in chronic, seropositive disease.
    *   **Pulmonary:** Interstitial lung disease (ILD), which can be exacerbated by certain medications like methotrexate.

**IV. DIAGNOSIS**
*   The 2010 ACR/EULAR Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis are used for diagnosis, requiring a score of ≥ 6 based on four domains: joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and duration of symptoms.
*   Under the 2010 criteria for RA, "small joints" include the MCPs, PIPs, MTPs (2-5), thumb IP, and wrists. "Large joints" include shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.
*   For arthritis lasting less than 6 weeks, viral arthritis (e.g., Chikungunya) should be considered as a differential diagnosis for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
*   **Rheumatoid Factor (RF):**
    *   An autoantibody (commonly IgM) directed against the Fc portion of IgG.
    *   A high titer of RF is a prognosticating factor, suggesting a more severe disease with extra-articular manifestations.
    *   Rheumatoid factor is sensitive but not specific for RA, as low titers can be seen in various infectious and chronic inflammatory conditions.
*   **Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP):**
    *   Antibodies that are more specific for Rheumatoid Arthritis than RF.
    *   The presence of anti-CCP antibodies is useful for the initial evaluation of unexplained joint inflammation and often indicates a more aggressive disease with a tendency for bone erosions.
*   **Synovial Fluid Analysis in Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
    *   Shows an inflammatory pattern with a WBC count of 5,000-50,000/μL, predominantly neutrophils.
    *   This test is not diagnostic for RA but is useful to confirm inflammatory arthritis and rule out infection or crystal-induced arthritis.
*   **Joint Imaging in Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
    *   Plain radiography in early RA may show periarticular osteopenia; erosions are a later finding.
    *   MRI is highly sensitive for detecting early synovitis and joint effusions.
    *   Ultrasound is useful for detecting erosions and synovitis, though it is operator-dependent.

**V. MANAGEMENT**
*   The primary goal of Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment is to achieve remission or low disease activity.
*   Treatment principles for Rheumatoid Arthritis include: 1) Early, aggressive treatment, 2) Frequent modification of DMARDs, 3) Individualization, 4) Minimal glucocorticoid use, and 5) Achieving remission.
*   Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis should be monitored regularly (e.g., every 3 months) to assess disease activity (using tools like the DAS28 joint count) and screen for medication side-effects.
*   **Pharmacologic agents for Rheumatoid Arthritis:**
    *   **NSAIDs:** Used as adjunct therapy for symptomatic relief.
    *   **Steroids:** Used for rapid disease control during initial diagnosis and for managing acute flares. The goal is to use the lowest possible dose (<7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent).
    *   **Conventional synthetic DMARDs (cDMARDs):** Methotrexate is the drug of choice and anchor drug. It is typically dosed once a week. Patients on methotrexate should receive folic acid supplementation.
    *   **Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs):** Targeted therapies like Anti-TNF agents (e.g., Infliximab, Etanercept), Anti-IL-6 agents, Abatacept, and Rituximab. A common adverse effect of anti-TNF agents is the reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
    *   **Targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs):** JAK inhibitors such as Tofacitinib and Baricitinib, which are oral medications.

### CHAPTER 362: SPONDYLOARTHRITIS (SpA)

**I. SPECTRUM OF SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES**
*   Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a group of inflammatory diseases that share common features, including sacroiliitis, enthesitis, and a strong association with HLA-B27.
*   The three most common types of Spondyloarthropathy are Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Reactive Arthritis.
*   SpA typically presents with an asymmetric, oligoarticular (four or less joints) inflammatory arthritis, often involving large joints in the lower limbs. This contrasts with the symmetric polyarthritis of RA.
*   Key musculoskeletal manifestations of SpA include sacroiliitis, inflammatory spinal lesions, enthesitis (inflammation at tendon/ligament insertion sites), and dactylitis ("sausage digits").

**II. ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS)**
*   Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the axial skeleton, though peripheral joints can be involved.
*   Ankylosing Spondylitis typically begins in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life, is more common in men, and has a strong association with HLA-B27.
*   Symmetrical sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of Ankylosing Spondylitis.
*   The radiographic hallmark of advanced Ankylosing Spondylitis is the "bamboo spine," resulting from vertebral body fusion by marginal syndesmophytes.
*   The Schober’s test is used to assess for decreased lumbar spine flexion, a common finding in Ankylosing Spondylitis.
*   Treatment for Ankylosing Spondylitis includes:
    *   **Exercise:** Critically important to maintain posture and range of motion.
    *   **NSAIDs:** First-line therapy to reduce pain and tenderness.
    *   **Biologics:** Anti-TNF and Anti-IL17 agents are highly effective and often used as first-line therapy.
    *   **Sulfasalazine:** Used for peripheral arthritis associated with AS.
*   A major and concerning complication of advanced Ankylosing Spondylitis is spinal fracture.

**III. PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS (PsA)**
*   Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease that characteristically occurs in patients with psoriasis and is usually rheumatoid factor (RF) negative.
*   In about 15% of Psoriatic Arthritis cases, arthritis develops before the onset of skin lesions.
*   Clinical findings in Psoriatic Arthritis include skin psoriasis, nail changes (pitting, onycholysis), and dactylitis ("sausage digits").
*   **The five patterns of Psoriatic Arthritis are:**
    1.  **Asymmetric Oligoarticular Arthritis:** The most common pattern, affecting <4 joints asymmetrically.
    2.  **Symmetrical Polyarthritis:** Mimics RA but is distinguished by RF negativity and DIP joint involvement.
    3.  **Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) Predominant Arthropathy:** Often associated with nail changes.
    4.  **Predominant Spondyloarthritis:** Affects the axial skeleton and must be distinguished from AS.
    5.  **Destructive (Arthritis Mutilans):** The most severe form, leading to a "pencil-in-cup" deformity on x-rays and telescoping of digits.
*   Diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis is primarily clinical. RF is negative in the majority, and there is no single diagnostic lab test. The CASPAR criteria are used for classification.
*   Treatment for Psoriatic Arthritis includes NSAIDs, DMARDs (methotrexate is first-line), and biologics (Anti-TNF, Anti-IL-23, Anti-IL-17).
*   Oral steroids are generally not advised in Psoriatic Arthritis as they can cause an exacerbation of skin lesions upon withdrawal.

**IV. REACTIVE ARTHRITIS (ReA)**
*   Reactive Arthritis (ReA) is an acute nonpurulent arthritis that develops 1-4 weeks after an extra-articular infection, where the microorganism does not enter the joint.
*   Common infectious triggers for Reactive Arthritis include genitourinary infections (most commonly *Chlamydia trachomatis*) and gastrointestinal infections (*Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia*).
*   The classic triad for Reactive Arthritis (formerly Reiter's Syndrome) is "Arthritis + Conjunctivitis + Urethritis."
*   Clinical manifestations of Reactive Arthritis include an acute, asymmetric oligoarthritis (predominantly lower limbs), dactylitis, enthesitis (e.g., heel pain), conjunctivitis, circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blenorrhagica (hyperkeratotic skin lesions on palms/soles).
*   Reactive Arthritis is typically self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks.
*   Treatment for Reactive Arthritis includes high-dose NSAIDs as first-line therapy. Antibiotics are used if the initial infection is still active. Sulfasalazine may be used for persistent cases (>6 weeks).

---
### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS & KEY DISTINCTIONS

*   **Symmetry & Joint Pattern:** Rheumatoid Arthritis is typically a symmetric polyarthritis affecting small joints (MCP, PIP). Spondyloarthropathies (like PsA and ReA) are typically an asymmetric oligoarthritis affecting large, lower-extremity joints.
*   **Morning Stiffness:** In Rheumatoid Arthritis, morning stiffness is prolonged, lasting > 1 hour. In Osteoarthritis (a key differential for joint pain), stiffness is brief, lasting < 30 minutes.
*   **Hand Joint Involvement:** Rheumatoid Arthritis classically affects the MCP and PIP joints, sparing the DIP joints. Psoriatic Arthritis characteristically involves the DIP joints.
*   **Key Serology Markers:** Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and Anti-CCP are markers for RA. HLA-B27 is the key genetic marker for Spondyloarthropathies, especially Ankylosing Spondylitis.
*   **RA vs. PsA Hand Findings:** RA is associated with swan neck and boutonniere deformities. PsA is associated with dactylitis ("sausage digit") and arthritis mutilans with "pencil-in-cup" deformity on x-ray.
*   **Radiographic Spine Findings:** Ankylosing Spondylitis shows symmetric, fine syndesmophytes leading to a "bamboo spine". Axial PsA tends to have asymmetric, bulkier, non-marginal syndesmophytes.
*   **RA vs. Symmetric PsA:** Symmetrical polyarthritis in PsA can mimic RA. Distinguishing features for PsA are a history of psoriasis, nail changes, DIP joint involvement, and negative RF.
*   **Role of Steroids:** Systemic steroids are a cornerstone for rapid control in RA flares. In contrast, oral steroids are generally avoided in Psoriatic Arthritis due to the risk of triggering a psoriasis flare-up.
*   **Extra-Articular Triggers:** Reactive Arthritis is distinctly triggered by a preceding GI or GU infection. No such acute trigger is characteristic of RA or PsA.
*   **Classic Triad:** Reactive Arthritis is associated with the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis.
*   **Skin Manifestations:** Psoriatic Arthritis is defined by psoriasis (erythematous, scaly plaques). Reactive Arthritis can cause keratoderma blenorrhagica (pustules and crusts on palms/soles).
*   **Synovial Fluid:** RA shows inflammatory fluid (WBC 5k-50k). This must be distinguished from septic arthritis (WBC >50k, positive culture) and Osteoarthritis (non-inflammatory, WBC <2k).
*   **First-Line Treatment for Arthritis:** In RA and PsA, the anchor drug is Methotrexate. In Ankylosing Spondylitis, first-line therapy is NSAIDs, with a strong push towards early use of biologics (Anti-TNF, Anti-IL-17).
*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis vs. other SpA:** AS is defined by its primary and severe involvement of the axial skeleton, leading to spinal fusion. While other SpAs can have axial involvement, it is the defining and central feature of AS.
*   **Dactylitis vs. Nodules:** Dactylitis ("sausage digit") is diffuse swelling of an entire finger or toe and is a hallmark of Psoriatic and Reactive Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are firm, subcutaneous lumps that occur over pressure points in seropositive RA.
