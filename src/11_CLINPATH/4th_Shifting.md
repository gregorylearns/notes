# INTRODUCTION TO CARDIAC BIOMARKERS AND ACS

* The ideal cardiac biochemical marker should be <b>sensitive</b>, <b>specific</b>, <b>significant</b> (right timing), and have <b>prognostic value</b>.
* <b>Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)</b> describes a range of conditions caused by <b>reduced blood flow</b> to the heart, including stable angina, unstable angina, Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), and Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD).
* <b>Unstable Angina</b> is characterized by chest pain <b>without</b> evidence of heart muscle damage.
* <b>Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)</b> is defined as heart muscle <b>damage/necrosis</b> due to a blockage in the coronary arteries.
* <b>Cardiac markers</b> are proteins released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged (myocyte necrosis).
* While ECG has limited sensitivity for ischemic injury, properly timed <b>serial biochemical markers</b> are the most clinically relevant assessment for myocardial necrosis.

# COMPARATIVE KINETICS OF CARDIAC MARKERS

| Biomarker | Tissue Source | Time to Increase | Peak Time | Duration of Elevation | Clinical Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b>Myoglobin</b> | Heart & Skeletal Muscle | <b>1-3 hours</b> | 8-12 hours | Within 24 hours | <b>Earliest marker</b>; high negative predictive value (rule-out). |
| <b>Troponin (cTnI/cTnT)</b> | Heart | <b>3-4 hours</b> | 24 hours | <b>10-14 days</b> | <b>Most specific</b>; gold standard for AMI diagnosis. |
| <b>CK-MB</b> | Heart & Skeletal Muscle | <b>3-6 hours</b> | 12-24 hours | 48-72 hours | Useful for <b>re-infarction</b> because it clears quickly. |
| <b>LDH</b> | Heart, RBCs, Liver, etc. | 12-24 hours | 48-72 hours | 10-14 days | Useful for <b>late presenters</b>. |
| <b>AST</b> | Heart, Liver, RBCs, Muscle | 6-8 hours | 24 hours | 5 days | Non-specific; indicates general inflammation/injury. |

# TROPONIN (cTnI and cTnT)

* <b>Troponin I (cTnI)</b> is considered the <b>most specific marker for AMI</b>.
* Cardiac Troponin consists of two releases: an <b>immediate release</b> of cytoplasmic troponin (within 4-8 hours) and a <b>sustained release</b> of bound troponin from degrading myofibrils (within 10-14 days).
* A <b>single positive result</b> for Troponin has high specificity for AMI, but serial testing is required because <b>sensitivity is limited</b> in the very early ( < 3 hours) or late (>12 hours) windows.
* Troponin is <b>not elevated in skeletal muscle injury</b> or vigorous exercise, unlike CK-MB and Myoglobin.
* In patients with <b>Unstable Angina</b>, increasing Troponin levels indicate a high risk of progression to AMI.
* In patients with <b>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</b>, Troponin T may be persistently slightly elevated due to reduced renal clearance and chronic myocardial stress.

# CREATINE KINASE (CK) AND ISOENZYMES

* <b>Creatine Kinase (CK)</b> total levels are non-specific and can be elevated in AMI, muscular dystrophy, strenuous exercise, and CVA.
* <b>CK-BB</b> is the fastest migrating isoenzyme found primarily in the <b>brain</b>, bladder, and stomach.
* <b>CK-MM</b> is the slowest migrating isoenzyme found primarily in <b>skeletal muscle</b>.
* <b>CK-MB</b> is the isoenzyme found primarily in <b>cardiac muscle</b> (and some skeletal muscle).
* <b>CK-MB</b> is the marker of choice for <b>diagnosing re-infarction</b> because it returns to baseline within 48-72 hours.
* Serial measurements of CK-MB increase diagnostic sensitivity; a <b>rising</b> trend suggests acute or extension of infarction, while a <b>falling</b> trend suggests resolution.

# MYOGLOBIN

* <b>Myoglobin</b> is the <b>earliest marker</b> of AMI, rising within 1-3 hours.
* Myoglobin has the <b>highest sensitivity</b> but the <b>least specificity</b> for heart injury, as it is found in all muscle tissue.
* A <b>normal Myoglobin result</b> within 2 hours of symptom onset has a <b>high negative predictive value</b>, effectively ruling out AMI.
* Myoglobin is a <b>small protein</b> soluble in the cytoplasm, allowing for <b>rapid leakage</b> through damaged membranes compared to larger proteins like Troponin.

# OTHER BIOMARKERS (LDH, BNP, CRP, IMA)

* <b>Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</b>: In a healthy state, LDH-2 > LDH-1. In AMI, the pattern is <b>"flipped" (LDH-1 > LDH-2)</b>.
* <b>Aspartate Transaminase (AST)</b>: Formerly SGOT; begins rising in 6-8 hours, but is non-specific as it is found in the liver and heart.
* <b>B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)</b>: Secreted by <b>ventricles</b> in response to wall stretch/volume overload; <b>excellent marker for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)</b>.
* <b>BNP</b> levels < 100 pg/mL indicate no HF, while levels > 600 pg/mL indicate moderate HF.
* <b>High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)</b>: A marker of <b>low-grade inflammation</b> and a strong predictor of <b>future cardiovascular risk</b>.
* An <b>hs-CRP level > 3.0 mg/L</b> indicates <b>High Risk</b> for future cardiovascular events; > 10 mg/L indicates an increased risk of recurrent events in unstable angina.
* <b>Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA)</b>: A marker of <b>active ischemia</b> (reduced oxygen/tissue stress) rather than necrosis; rises before Troponin.
* IMA results from the <b>reduced cobalt-binding capacity</b> of albumin caused by an acidic, hypoxemic, or free-radical environment.

# REPERFUSION AND RISK ASSESSMENT

* <b>"Washout Phenomenon" (Cardiac Reperfusion)</b>: Occurs after successful treatment (like PCI) where cardiac markers rise/peak <b>much faster and higher</b> than in unperfused cases.
* In the <b>Washout Phenomenon</b>, the rapid flush of accumulated markers into systemic circulation reflects <b>successful restoration of blood flow</b> rather than a larger area of damage.
* <b>GRACE Risk 2.0</b> is a clinical registry used to predict the risk of MI and death; it is considered <b>more predictive than the TIMI score</b>.
* Re-infarction is suspected if <b>CK-MB rises again</b> after it has already begun to decline toward its 48-72 hour baseline.

# SPECIAL CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS

* <b>Exertional Rhabdomyolysis</b>: Characterized by <b>very high Total CK (e.g., 15,000 U/L)</b> and dark urine, but <b>Normal Troponin I</b> (differentiating it from AMI).
* <b>Silent MI in Diabetics</b>: Poorly controlled diabetics may present with <b>vague fatigue or indigestion</b> instead of chest pain due to <b>Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy</b>.
* <b>Troponin T vs. Troponin I</b>: Both are heart-specific, but Troponin T is more likely to be <b>persistently elevated in Renal Failure/CKD</b>.
* <b>Acute Myocardial Infarction Diagnosis</b>: Requires a Troponin level > 99th percentile plus a <b>dynamic "rise and fall" (delta)</b> and clinical/ECG evidence of ischemia.

# KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FOR EXAMS

* <b>Troponin I vs Myoglobin</b>: Troponin I is the <b>most specific</b> (Gold Standard); Myoglobin is the <b>most sensitive/earliest</b> (Best for rule-out).
* <b>CK-MB vs Troponin</b>: CK-MB is the <b>preferred choice for re-infarction</b> due to its 3-day duration; Troponin is <b>unreliable for re-infarction</b> because it stays elevated for 10-14 days.
* <b>IMA vs Troponin</b>: IMA measures <b>ischemia</b> (loss of oxygen, reversible); Troponin measures <b>necrosis</b> (cell death, irreversible).
* <b>LDH-1 vs LDH-2</b>: Normal is <b>LD2 > LD1</b>; Myocardial Infarction is <b>LD1 > LD2</b> (The "Flipped Ratio").
* <b>BNP vs Troponin</b>: BNP indicates <b>ventricular stretch/heart failure</b>; Troponin indicates <b>ventricular damage/infarction</b>.
* <b>Standard CRP vs hs-CRP</b>: Standard CRP (>10 mg/L) measures <b>acute infection</b>; hs-CRP (<10 mg/L) measures <b>low-grade inflammation and cardiac risk</b>.
* <b>Chest Pain in AMI vs Unstable Angina</b>: AMI has <b>elevated cardiac markers</b>; Unstable Angina has chest pain <b>without</b> elevated cardiac markers.
* <b>Troponin in CKD vs AMI</b>: In CKD, Troponin is <b>persistently elevated</b> without a dynamic change; in AMI, there is a clear <b>"rise and fall" (delta)</b>.
* <b>CK-MB in Rhabdomyolysis vs AMI</b>: In skeletal muscle injury, <b>Total CK is massively elevated</b> with Normal Troponin; in AMI, CK-MB and Troponin are concordantly elevated.
* <b>Early vs Late Presentation</b>: <b>Myoglobin</b> is best for presentation < 3 hours; <b>LDH and Troponin</b> are best for presentation > 48 hours.

## Summary

### **Topic: Liver Function Tests (LFTs) & Hepatocellular Enzymes**

* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)</font></b> is primarily a marker of hepatocyte injury and is more specific to the liver than AST.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)</font></b> is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain; its highest concentration is in the heart.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">DeRitis Ratio (AST/ALT Ratio)</font></b> is normally < 1; however, a ratio > 1 suggests severe damage involving the mitochondria, typically seen in <b><font color="red">Alcoholic abuse</font></b> and <b><font color="red">Cirrhosis</font></b>.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">AST t1/2</font></b> is approximately 16-18 hours, whereas <b><font color="red">ALT t1/2</font></b> is significantly longer at 40-48 hours.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">Transaminase elevations > 3x ULN</font></b> are rarely observed in nonhepatic diseases, with <b><font color="red">Rhabdomyolysis</font></b> being a notable exception.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">Viral Hepatitis</font></b> typically presents with <b><font color="red">ALT > AST</font></b>, while <b><font color="red">Alcoholic Hepatitis</font></b> presents with <b><font color="red">AST > ALT</font></b>.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD)</font></b> isoenzymes <b><font color="red">LD4 and LD5</font></b> are the slowest markers and are specifically elevated in liver damage or skeletal muscle insults.
* In Liver Function Tests, an <b><font color="red">LD1 > LD2 ratio</font></b> is referred to as a "Flipped LD Ratio" and indicates Myocardial Infarction (MI), Hemolysis, or Renal Infarction.

### **Topic: Biliary Excretory Function & Ammonia**

* In LFT interpretation, <b><font color="red">Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)</font></b> elevation is highly sensitive for <b><font color="red">Cholestatic</font></b> or <b><font color="red">Infiltrative (Metastatic)</font></b> liver disease.
* In LFT interpretation, <b><font color="red">GGT and 5’ Nucleotidase</font></b> are used as adjunctive tests; if normal when ALP is high, the excess ALP is likely of <b><font color="red">bone origin</font></b>.
* In differentiating ALP sources via heat inactivation, <b><font color="red">Bone ALP</font></b> is 90% inactivated ("Bone Burns"), while <b><font color="red">Placental ALP</font></b> is resistant to L-phenylalanine inhibition.
* In LFT interpretation, <b><font color="red">Regan Isoenzyme</font></b> is a form of ALP identical to the placental type found in some patients with <b><font color="red">malignant disease</font></b>.
* In LFT interpretation, <b><font color="red">GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)</font></b> is a sensitive indicator of biliary injury and alcohol use; levels typically return to normal in <b><font color="red">3 weeks</font></b> after abstinence.
* In Liver Function Tests, <b><font color="red">Ammonia</font></b> levels are used to assess hepatic dysfunction and are associated with <b><font color="red">Asterixis</font></b> (flapping tremor) in hepatic encephalopathy.

### **Topic: Bilirubin Metabolism & Hyperbilirubinemia**

* In Bilirubin metabolism, <b><font color="red">Unconjugated (Indirect) Bilirubin</font></b> is water-insoluble, bound to albumin, and produced from heme breakdown via macrophages.
* In Bilirubin metabolism, <b><font color="red">Conjugated (Direct) Bilirubin</font></b> is water-soluble, processed by the enzyme <b><font color="red">UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1)</font></b> in the liver.
* In Clinical Diagnosis, <b><font color="red">Bilirubinuria</font></b> always indicates <b><font color="red">Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</font></b> because unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble.
* In prolonged jaundice, <b><font color="red">Delta-Bilirubin (D-albumin)</font></b> is formed when conjugated bilirubin covalently links to albumin; it is unexcretable and persists after the underlying cause resolves.
* In Clinical Diagnosis, <b><font color="red">Acholic/Silver Stool (Thomas Stool)</font></b> indicates complete biliary obstruction due to lack of stercobilin.

* In pediatrics, <b><font color="red">Kernicterus</font></b> is the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in brain structures like the <b><font color="red">basal ganglia</font></b> and <b><font color="red">hippocampus</font></b> due to a poorly developed Blood-Brain Barrier.
* In pediatrics, <b><font color="red">Phototherapy</font></b> is used for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia to convert bilirubin into a soluble molecule for excretion; it is <b><font color="red">not useful</font></b> for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
* <b><font color="red">Pathologic Neonatal Jaundice</font></b> is suspected if jaundice occurs within the <b><font color="red">first 24 hours of life</font></b> or if total bilirubin is <b><font color="red">> 12 mg/dL</font></b>.
