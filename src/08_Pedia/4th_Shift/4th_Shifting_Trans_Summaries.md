## Summary

### GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA

---

#### **_STAPHYLOCOCCUS_**

*   _Staphylococcus_ species are Gram-positive cocci that appear in pairs and clusters.
*   _Staphylococcus aureus_ is coagulase-positive.
*   Coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ (CONS) species include _S. epidermidis_, _S. saprophyticus_, and _S. haemolyticus_.
*   A blood culture with an Antimicrobial Removal Device (ARD) is ordered if a patient is already on antimicrobials.
*   For blood cultures, samples are taken from two sites. Growth from only one site often suggests contamination with coagulase-negative skin flora.

---

#### **1. _Staphylococcus aureus_**

*   _S. aureus_ is a component of the normal flora of humans and can be found on fomites and in dust.
*   _S. aureus_ is the **most common cause of pyogenic skin & soft tissue infection**.
*   Bacteremia is common with _S. aureus_ infections.
*   Tissue invasion and injury from _S. aureus_ are due to its toxins and enzymes.
*   The hallmark of an _S. aureus_ infection is the formation of an **abscess**.
*   Transmission of _S. aureus_ is primarily by direct contact and auto-inoculation.
*   _S. aureus_ is the most important cause of **neonatal infections**.
*   _S. aureus_ is the most common cause of **osteomyelitis and suppurative arthritis** in children.
*   _S. aureus_ is a common cause of **acute endocarditis**.
*   _S. aureus_ is the most common cause of **renal & perinephric abscesses**, which are usually hematogenous in origin.
*   _S. aureus_ is the principal cause of **Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**.
*   Individuals with atopic skin are more susceptible to secondary staphylococcal infections.
*   A pimple pop can lead to systemic _S. aureus_ infection, causing osteomyelitis, infective endocarditis, or septic arthritis.
*   MRSA stands for Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_.

##### **_S. aureus_ - Pathogenesis**
*   _S. aureus_ produces **Enterotoxins A, B, C1, C2, D, and E**, which are associated with food poisoning.
*   _S. aureus_ produces **Exfoliative toxins A and B**, which cause Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS).
*   _S. aureus_ produces **Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1)**, responsible for Toxic Shock Syndrome.

##### **_S. aureus_ - Clinical Manifestations**
*   _S. aureus_ can cause a wide range of infections including pneumonia, sepsis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, acute endocarditis, Toxic Shock Syndrome, and food poisoning.
*   In an immunocompromised individual, _S. aureus_ can cause lobar pneumonia.

##### **_S. aureus_ - Diagnosis**
*   Diagnosis of _S. aureus_ infection is made by isolating the organism from normally nonpermissive sites like cellulitis aspirates, abscess cavities, or blood.
*   Laboratory diagnosis involves Gram staining, and testing for Coagulase, clumping factor, or Protein A reactivity.

##### **_S. aureus_ - Treatment**
*   For initial empiric therapy of a non-life-threatening infection without signs of sepsis, **oxacillin** is used.
*   For initial empiric therapy of a life-threatening infection, **vancomycin** is used.
*   If MRSA is suspected, **clindamycin** is considered; however, if there is CNS involvement, **vancomycin or linezolid** is used.
*   For less serious infections caused by Methicillin-Susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA), oral options include **Dicloxacillin**, **Cefalexin**, or **Amoxicillin-Clavulanate**.
*   A common side effect of vancomycin is Red Man Syndrome.
*   Dicloxacillin is not recommended for dermatologic use due to poor bioavailability; **cefalexin** or **amoxicillin-clavulanate** are preferred alternatives.

| Infection Type | Recommended Treatment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Empiric Therapy** | Non-life-threatening: Oxacillin<br>Life-threatening: Vancomycin |

*   CONS are normal inhabitants of human skin, throat, mouth, vagina, and urethra.
*   **_S. epidermidis_** is the most common species of CONS.
*   CONS are known to produce a slime layer, which helps them adhere to surfaces like catheters.
*   CONS are most commonly associated with **catheter infections**.

##### **CONS - Clinical Manifestations**
*   CONS infections can manifest as bacteremia, endocarditis, infections of CSF shunts, and urinary tract infections.

##### **CONS - Treatment**

---

#### **2. Group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) / _Streptococcus pyogenes_**

*   Group A _Streptococcus_ (_S. pyogenes_) are Gram-positive cocci that grow in chains.
*   The natural reservoir for GAS is humans.
*   Virulence of GAS is primarily due to **M protein** and **erythrogenic toxins**.

##### **GAS - Clinical Manifestations**
*   GAS causes respiratory tract infections like acute pharyngitis and pneumonia.
*   GAS causes skin infections like impetigo and erysipelas.
*   Untreated GAS pharyngitis (tonsillitis) can lead to cardiac complications, hence treatment for 10 days is crucial.
*   **Scarlet fever** is a GAS infection characterized by a **"sandpaper" rash**, **strawberry tongue**, and **Pastia's lines** (lines in skin folds). Its differential diagnosis includes Kawasaki Disease.
*   Severe invasive GAS diseases include GAS Toxic Shock Syndrome and GAS necrotizing fasciitis.

##### **GAS - Diagnosis**
*   Diagnosis of GAS infection is made by culture (e.g., throat swab).
*   Streptococcal antibody titers, such as **Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer** and **Anti-DNase B**, can provide evidence of a recent infection.

##### **GAS - Treatment**
*   The drug of choice for GAS pharyngitis is **penicillin for 10 days**.
*   For patients with poor compliance, a single IM dose of **Benzathine penicillin G** can be used.
*   Alternatives to penicillin include Amoxicillin, Cephalosporins, Clindamycin, and Macrolides.

##### **GAS - Complications**
*   Complications of GAS infections are categorized as suppurative or non-suppurative.
*   The two major non-suppurative complications are **Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)** and **Post-streptococcal Acute Glomerulonephritis (AGN)**.
*   Acute Glomerulonephritis may occur 2 weeks to 1 month after the primary GAS infection.

---

#### **Rheumatic Fever**

##### **Rheumatic Fever - Pathogenesis**
*   One theory of ARF pathogenesis is the **immunologic theory**, where components of GAS (like M protein) share antigens with human tissues (heart, brain, joints), leading to immunologic cross-reactivity.
*   Another theory is the **cytotoxic theory**, where enzymes from GAS are directly toxic to cardiac cells.

##### **Rheumatic Fever - Jones Criteria**
*   The diagnosis of Acute Rheumatic Fever is based on the **Jones Criteria**: 2 major criteria OR 1 major and 2 minor criteria.
*   The **major criteria** for ARF are: **C**arditis, migratory **P**olyarthritis, **C**horea (Sydenham), **E**rythema marginatum, and **S**ubcutaneous nodules.
*   **Carditis** is the most serious manifestation of ARF, with valvulitis being a universal finding. It can lead to murmurs, cardiomegaly, and CHF.
*   **Migratory Polyarthritis** affects large joints and often has an inverse relationship with the severity of carditis.
*   **Chorea** is a late manifestation characterized by emotional lability and uncontrollable movements.
*   **Erythema marginatum** is a non-pruritic, serpiginous rash with pale centers on the trunk and extremities.
*   **Subcutaneous nodules** are firm, painless nodules found over bony prominences.
*   The **minor criteria** include fever, arthralgia, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP), and a prolonged PR interval on ECG.
*   A diagnosis of ARF can sometimes be made without meeting the full Jones criteria in cases of pure **chorea**, **indolent carditis**, or **recurrent ARF**.

##### **Rheumatic Fever - Treatment**
*   Antibiotic therapy, such as **penicillin for 10 days** or a single dose of **Benzathine penicillin IM**, is given to eradicate GAS.
*   Anti-inflammatory therapy includes **aspirin** for arthritis and mild carditis, or **corticosteroids (Prednisone)** for severe carditis with cardiomegaly or CHF.
*   **Phenobarbital** is the drug of choice for managing chorea.

##### **Rheumatic Fever - Prognosis & Prevention**
*   Long-term sequelae of ARF are usually limited to the heart (rheumatic heart disease).
*   Prognosis depends on the severity of the initial cardiac involvement.
*   **Primary prevention** of ARF involves treating GAS pharyngitis promptly with antibiotics.
*   **Secondary prevention** involves continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., monthly Benzathine penicillin G) to prevent recurrent attacks in patients with a history of ARF.
*   The duration of secondary prophylaxis depends on the presence and severity of residual heart disease, ranging from 5 years to lifelong.

#### **3. Group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS) / _Streptococcus agalactiae_**

*   Group B _Streptococcus_ (_S. agalactiae_) are anaerobic Gram-positive cocci in chains or pairs.
*   GBS virulence is attributed to its polysaccharide capsule, surface proteins, and enzymes like B-hemolysin and hyaluronidase.
*   GBS is a common etiologic agent of **neonatal sepsis**, along with _E. coli_ and _Listeria monocytogenes_.
*   **Early-onset GBS disease** occurs within the first 7 days of life, presents as sepsis or pneumonia, and has a higher fatality rate.
*   **Late-onset GBS disease** occurs after 7 days of life, commonly presents as meningitis, and is associated with acquisition from the environment or community.
*   Maternal risk factors for early-onset GBS disease include GBS colonization, previous infant with GBS disease, prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM > 18 hours), and intrapartum fever.

##### **GBS - Diagnosis**
*   Diagnosis is made by isolating and identifying GBS from normally sterile sites like blood, urine, or CSF.
*   Lab findings may include neutropenia/neutrophilia, increased bands, leukopenia, and elevated CRP.

##### **GBS - Treatment**
*   Initial **empiric treatment** for suspected neonatal sepsis is a combination of **Ampicillin and an Aminoglycoside**.
*   The drug of choice for confirmed GBS infection is **Penicillin G**.

##### **GBS - Prevention**
*   Prevention involves **chemoprophylaxis**. Pregnant women are screened for vaginorectal GBS colonization at **35-37 weeks of gestation**.
*   Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, with **Penicillin** as the drug of choice, is given to GBS-positive mothers to prevent transmission to the newborn.

#### **_ENTEROCOCCUS_**

*   _Enterococcus_ species are Gram-positive facultative anaerobes found in pairs or short chains.
*   _Enterococcus_ is a common cause of **hospital-acquired infections** and is frequently resistant to multiple antibiotics.
*   _E. faecalis_ accounts for about 80% of infections.
*   In neonates, _Enterococcus_ can cause early-onset (<7 days) or late-onset (≥7 days) sepsis, with the latter having a higher mortality rate.
*   In older children, _Enterococcus_ is a cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections (15%).

##### **_Enterococcus_ - Treatment**
*   For minor infections in immunocompetent patients, **Ampicillin** is used.

---

#### **_CORYNEBACTERIUM DIPHTHERIAE_**

*   _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ is an aerobic, Gram-positive bacillus that causes **diphtheria**, an acute toxin-mediated disease.
*   On Gram stain, they appear as **club-shaped** bacilli, sometimes in a palisading arrangement.
*   The organism is an exclusive inhabitant of human mucous membranes and skin.
*   Only strains lysogenized by a bacteriophage carrying the `tox` gene are toxigenic and can cause severe disease.

##### **_C. diphtheriae_ - Pathogenesis**
*   The diphtheria **exotoxin** inhibits cellular protein synthesis, leading to tissue destruction and the formation of a **pseudomembrane**.
*   The toxin can be absorbed into the bloodstream, causing systemic effects like myocarditis, neuritis, and kidney tubule necrosis.
*   Non-toxigenic strains can cause mild pharyngitis but do not form a pseudomembrane.
*   Transmission is via airborne respiratory **droplets** or **direct contact** with secretions.

##### **_C. diphtheriae_ - Clinical Features**
*   The incubation period for diphtheria is 2-4 days.
*   **Pharyngeal and Tonsillar Diphtheria** is the most common form, presenting with sore throat and an adherent, grayish-green pseudomembrane that **bleeds on forceful removal**.
*   Significant soft tissue edema can lead to the characteristic **"bull-neck" appearance** and airway compromise.
*   **Laryngeal Diphtheria** presents with hoarseness and a barking cough, posing a risk of airway obstruction.
*   **Anterior Nasal Diphtheria** is a milder form with a serosanguineous discharge and a white membrane on the nasal septum.
*   **Cutaneous Diphtheria** appears as nonhealing ulcers with a gray-brown membrane.

##### **_C. diphtheriae_ - Complications**
*   The most frequent and severe complications are **myocarditis** and **neuritis**, which are attributable to the toxin.
*   Toxic cardiomyopathy can lead to dysrhythmias and heart failure and accounts for 50-60% of deaths.
*   Toxic neuropathy can cause paralysis of the soft palate and other cranial or peripheral neuropathies.

##### **_C. diphtheriae_ - Diagnosis & Treatment**
*   Diagnosis is made by **culture of the lesion**.
*   The **mainstay of therapy is equine Diphtheria antitoxin**, which neutralizes unbound circulating toxin.
*   **Antibiotics** (e.g., **Erythromycin** or **Penicillin**) are given to halt toxin production and prevent transmission.

##### **_C. diphtheriae_ - Prevention**
*   Patients require **droplet precautions** (for pharyngeal disease) or **contact precautions** (for cutaneous disease).
*   Close contacts should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis (Erythromycin or Benzathine penicillin G).
*   **Vaccination** with the **Diphtheria toxoid** is the most effective means of prevention.

#### **_LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES_**

*   _Listeria monocytogenes_ is a facultative anaerobic, motile, Gram-positive bacillus capable of surviving as an **intracellular** pathogen.
*   Listeriosis is a **food-borne** illness, often linked to aged soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk products, and contaminated ready-to-eat meats.
*   The disease is most common at the **extremes of age** (newborns and elderly) and in the immunosuppressed.
*   In pregnancy, listeriosis can cause a flu-like illness in the mother, potentially leading to seeding of the uterine contents and neonatal infection.

##### **_L. monocytogenes_ - Manifestations**
*   **Early-onset neonatal listeriosis** (<5 days) is a multisystem disease acquired in utero, often associated with premature delivery, and has a high mortality rate (>30%). A characteristic finding is granulomatosis infantisepticum.
*   **Late-onset neonatal listeriosis** (≥5 days) is usually acquired after birth, presents as meningitis, and typically affects term infants.
*   In older children and adults, it usually affects the immunosuppressed, causing meningitis or sepsis.

##### **_L. monocytogenes_ - Diagnosis & Treatment**
*   Diagnosis is confirmed by **culture from blood or CSF**.
*   Treatment for listeriosis is **Ampicillin**, often with the addition of an **Aminoglycoside** for synergy.

*   The **most frequent neurologic sequela** of meningococcal meningitis is **deafness** (5-10% of cases).

##### **_N. meningitidis_ - Diagnosis**
*   The **gold standard** for diagnosis is the **isolation of the organism from blood, CSF, or petechial lesions**.
*   A rapid presumptive diagnosis can be made from a Gram stain of a needle aspirate from a skin lesion, which shows **Gram-negative diplococci**.
*   Rapid latex agglutination tests on CSF can detect capsular antigens but may have false negatives.

##### **_N. meningitidis_ - Treatment**
*   Empiric treatment for suspected meningococcal disease is a **third-generation cephalosporin** (e.g., **Ceftriaxone** or **Cefotaxime**).
*   Patients should be placed on **droplet precautions** for 24 hours after the initiation of effective antibiotic therapy.

#### **_HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE_ TYPE B (Hib)**

*   _Haemophilus influenzae_ is a Gram-negative coccobacillus.
*   Strains are categorized as encapsulated (typeable) or unencapsulated (nontypeable). **Type b (Hib)** was a major cause of invasive disease before vaccination.
*   Humans are the only natural hosts, and transmission is via respiratory droplets.
*   **Nontypeable strains** typically cause noninvasive infections like otitis media and sinusitis.
*   Invasive Hib disease historically had a high incidence in young children due to an immature immune response to its polysaccharide capsule.

##### **Hib - Clinical Manifestations**
*   The most common types of invasive Hib disease are **meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, arthritis, and cellulitis**.
*   **Epiglottitis** (supraglottitis) is a **medical emergency** due to the risk of sudden airway obstruction.
*   Hib **cellulitis** classically affects the **cheek** or **periorbital (pre-septal) area**, often with a characteristic bluish-purple discoloration.
*   Hib septic arthritis commonly affects large joints like the knee, hip, or ankle.

##### **Hib - Diagnosis & Treatment**
*   Diagnosis is made by Gram staining and culture of specimens from sterile sites.
*   The drug of choice for susceptible strains is **Ampicillin**.
*   For invasive disease or resistant cases, a **third-generation cephalosporin (Ceftriaxone, Cefotaxime)** is used.
*   For non-invasive disease like otitis media, **Amoxicillin** or **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** is used.

##### **Hib - Prevention**
*   Invasive Hib disease is now rare in immunized populations due to the highly effective **Hib conjugate vaccine**.
*   Post-exposure **prophylaxis** with **Rifampicin** is recommended for household contacts if there is an unimmunized or immunocompromised child in the home.

---

#### **_BORDETELLA PERTUSSIS_**

*   _Bordetella pertussis_ is a small, aerobic Gram-negative coccobacillus that causes **pertussis (whooping cough)**.
*   It is extremely contagious and transmitted by **aerosol droplets**.
*   The **Pertussis toxin (PT)** is the major virulence protein and is responsible for many systemic effects, including profound lymphocytosis.

##### **_B. pertussis_ - Clinical Manifestations**
*   The illness progresses through three stages:
    1.  **Catarrhal stage (1-2 weeks):** Resembles a common cold with cough, coryza, and low-grade fever.
    2.  **Paroxysmal stage (2-6 weeks):** Characterized by intense, repetitive bursts of coughing (paroxysms) followed by a high-pitched inspiratory "whoop". Post-tussive vomiting is common.
    3.  **Convalescent stage (weeks to months):** Gradual recovery with a lingering cough.
*   In infants <3 months old, the "whoop" is often absent, and the presentation may be apnea, gasping, or cyanosis.
*   Pertussis should be suspected in any person with a cough lasting ≥14 days, especially with associated paroxysms, whoop, or post-tussive vomiting.
*   A key laboratory finding is **marked leukocytosis with an absolute lymphocytosis**.

##### **_B. pertussis_ - Diagnosis & Treatment**
*   The **gold standard** for diagnosis is **culture** from a nasopharyngeal swab. PCR is also widely used.
*   Antibiotics are given to limit the spread of infection and may ameliorate the illness if given early (in the catarrhal stage).
*   The drug of choice is a **macrolide**, such as **Azithromycin**. Erythromycin is avoided in infants <1 month old due to the risk of pyloric stenosis.
*   Infants <3 months old should be hospitalized for monitoring.

##### **_B. pertussis_ - Complications & Prevention**
*   The most common complications are **apnea**, **secondary pneumonia**, and physical sequelae from forceful coughing (e.g., petechiae, epistaxis, hernias).
*   **Neither natural disease nor vaccination provides lifelong immunity**. Protection begins to wane 3-5 years after vaccination.
*   Prevention is through vaccination with the acellular pertussis component in DTaP, Tdap vaccines.

#### **_SALMONELLA_**

##### **1. Nontyphoidal Salmonellosis**
*   Caused by serotypes like **_S. enteritidis_** and **_S. typhimurium_**.
*   It is a major cause of childhood diarrheal illness, primarily transmitted from **animal reservoirs** (poultry, eggs, reptiles) via contaminated food.
*   The most common manifestation is **acute enteritis** (gastroenteritis) with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which is usually self-limited.
*   Antibiotics are generally **not recommended** for uncomplicated cases in healthy children, as they can prolong shedding.
*   Antibiotics are indicated for infants <3 months old and high-risk groups (e.g., immunocompromised, sickle cell disease).
*   A major complication in patients with sickle cell disease is **osteomyelitis**.

##### **2. Enteric Fever (Typhoid Fever)**
*   Caused by **_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi** (and less commonly, Paratyphi).
*   Transmission is exclusively from **human carriers** via the fecal-oral route (contaminated food or water).
*   The incubation period is longer (7-14 days).
*   It is a systemic illness where bacteria invade Peyer's patches, enter the bloodstream, and disseminate to the reticuloendothelial system.
*   Clinical features include a prolonged, **step-ladder fever**, malaise, headache, constipation (early) or diarrhea (later), and sometimes **"rose spots"** on the trunk.
*   The **gold standard** for diagnosis is culture, with **bone marrow culture** being the most sensitive. Blood culture is most likely positive in the first week.
*   **Widal test** is often used but lacks sensitivity and specificity.
*   Treatment requires antibiotics, such as **Ceftriaxone**, **Azithromycin**, or a **fluoroquinolone** (e.g., Ciprofloxacin).
*   **Dexamethasone** is given to severely ill patients with shock or an altered mental state.
*   Prevention is through sanitation, safe water, and vaccination (**oral live attenuated Ty21a** or **injectable Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine**).

#### **_SHIGELLA_**

*   _Shigella_ species cause **bacillary dysentery**, a severe inflammatory colitis.
*   The infective dose is very low (as few as 10 organisms). Transmission is fecal-oral.
*   The target organ is the colon, where the bacteria invade epithelial cells, causing inflammation and ulceration.
*   Clinical presentation includes high fever, abdominal cramps, tenesmus (painful defecation), and diarrhea that progresses from watery to grossly **bloody and mucoid**.
*   A classic physical exam finding is a spurt of bloody stool upon digital rectal examination.
*   Neurologic findings, especially **seizures**, are common in young children.
*   A severe complication is **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**, particularly with _S. dysenteriae_ type 1, which produces Shiga toxin.
*   The **Ekiri syndrome** is a rare, rapidly fatal toxic encephalopathy associated with shigellosis.
*   Diagnosis can be presumed by finding numerous fecal leukocytes (>50 PMNs/HPF) on a stool smear. Confirmatory diagnosis is by **stool culture**.
*   Treatment includes supportive care (fluids, electrolytes) and **antibiotics** like **Ceftriaxone**, **Azithromycin**, or **Ciprofloxacin** to shorten the illness and reduce transmission.

*   **Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC):** Produces heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) toxins. Causes secretory, watery diarrhea. A major cause of **traveler's diarrhea** and infantile diarrhea in developing countries.
*   **Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC):** Invades the colonic mucosa, similar to _Shigella_. Causes an inflammatory colitis with fever and **bloody stools (dysentery)**.
*   **Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC):** A major cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries. Adheres to the small intestine, causing "attaching and effacing" lesions. Leads to non-bloody, mucoid diarrhea that can be persistent.
*   **Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC/EHEC):** Produces Shiga toxins (Stx1, Stx2). Causes hemorrhagic colitis (bloody diarrhea), but **fever is uncommon**. A major cause of **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**. The most famous serotype is O157:H7.
*   **Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC):** Adheres to the intestinal mucosa in a "stacked brick" pattern. Causes persistent, secretory diarrhea, especially in children in developing countries and AIDS patients.
*   Treatment is primarily supportive with fluid and electrolyte therapy. Antibiotics are generally not recommended, especially for STEC (may increase HUS risk).

#### **_VIBRIO CHOLERAE_**

*   _Vibrio cholerae_ is a Gram-negative, comma-shaped bacillus that causes **cholera**.
*   Transmission is via **contaminated water** or undercooked shellfish.
*   The organism colonizes the small intestine and produces **cholera toxin**.
*   Cholera toxin leads to massive, cAMP-mediated secretion of chloride and water into the intestinal lumen.
*   This results in profuse, watery diarrhea described as **"rice-water stools"** with a fishy odor.
*   The hallmark of cholera is **severe dehydration**, which can rapidly lead to hypovolemic shock, metabolic acidosis, and death if not treated.
*   On dark-field microscopy of a fresh stool sample, the organisms exhibit a characteristic **"darting motility"**.
*   The **mainstay of therapy is rapid and aggressive rehydration**, either with oral rehydration solution (ORS) for mild/moderate cases or intravenous fluids for severe dehydration.
*   **Antibiotics** (e.g., **Doxycycline**, **Azithromycin**) can shorten the duration of diarrhea and reduce fluid requirements but are secondary to rehydration.
*   Prevention relies on sanitation, clean water access, and vaccination.

### **HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS FOR EXAMS**
---

*   ***S. aureus* vs. Coagulase-Negative Staph (CONS):** *S. aureus* is coagulase-positive and causes pyogenic infections (abscesses, osteomyelitis), while CONS are coagulase-negative, produce a slime layer, and are a primary cause of foreign body/catheter-related infections.

*   **Pneumococcal Vaccines (PCV vs. PPSV):** PCV (conjugate) is effective in infants <2 years, induces T-cell dependent immune memory, and provides herd immunity. PPSV (polysaccharide) is for >2 years, provides T-cell independent immunity without memory, and does not provide herd immunity.

*   **Group A Strep (GAS) vs. Group B Strep (GBS):** GAS causes pharyngitis and skin infections in children/adults with post-infectious sequelae like Rheumatic Fever and AGN. GBS is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, acquired from the maternal genital tract.

*   **Early-onset vs. Late-onset GBS Disease:** Early-onset occurs <7 days of life, typically presents as sepsis/pneumonia, is acquired vertically from the mother, and has a higher mortality rate. Late-onset occurs ≥7 days, often presents as meningitis, and is acquired from the environment.

*   **Scarlet Fever vs. Kawasaki Disease:** Both can present with a strawberry tongue and rash. Scarlet fever is caused by GAS, has a sandpaper rash, and resolves with antibiotics. Kawasaki disease is an idiopathic vasculitis, features a polymorphous rash, conjunctivitis, and requires IVIG/aspirin to prevent coronary artery aneurysms.

*   **Rheumatic Fever Carditis vs. Endocarditis from _S. aureus_:** RF carditis is a non-suppurative, post-infectious (GAS) pancarditis, often leading to chronic valvular stenosis years later. _S. aureus_ endocarditis is an acute, destructive, suppurative infection of the heart valves, often from bacteremia.

*   **Pharyngeal Diphtheria vs. Hib Epiglottitis:** Both cause airway obstruction. Diphtheria features a grayish, adherent pseudomembrane that bleeds when scraped, hoarseness, and a "bull-neck" appearance. Epiglottitis has a rapid onset, drooling, tripod positioning, and a "cherry-red" epiglottis on visualization.

*   **Staphylococcal TSS vs. Streptococcal TSS (GAS):** Staph TSS is often associated with tampons, bacteremia is uncommon, and the rash is a diffuse erythema. Strep TSS is almost always associated with a soft-tissue infection (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis), bacteremia is common, and it has a higher mortality rate.

*   **Meningitis Triad (*S. pneumoniae*, *N. meningitidis*, Hib):** All cause fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Distinguishing clues include: *S. pneumoniae* (G+ diplococci) associated with pneumonia/otitis; *N. meningitidis* (G- diplococci) associated with a petechial/purpuric rash; Hib (G- coccobacilli) associated with epiglottitis or buccal cellulitis.

*   **Nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ vs. Typhoid Fever (*S. typhi*):** Nontyphoidal salmonellosis is a zoonosis causing self-limited gastroenteritis. Typhoid fever is a human-only disease causing a systemic febrile illness with bacteremia, rose spots, and requires mandatory antibiotic treatment.

*   ***Shigella* vs. Shiga Toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC):** Both can cause bloody diarrhea and HUS. _Shigella_ infection (dysentery) is typically accompanied by high fever and is invasive. STEC infection (hemorrhagic colitis) classically has little to no fever.

*   **Invasive vs. Toxin-Mediated Diarrhea:** Invasive diarrhea (*Shigella*, EIEC, *Campylobacter*) involves bacterial invasion of the gut mucosa, resulting in inflammation, fever, and fecal leukocytes/blood (dysentery). Toxin-mediated diarrhea (*V. cholerae*, ETEC) involves enterotoxins that cause fluid secretion without invasion, resulting in profuse watery diarrhea with no fever or fecal leukocytes.

### CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS

#### MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (THE ORGANISM)
* In Childhood TB, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is the most important cause of TB disease in humans.
* *M. tuberculosis* is a non-sporeforming, non-motile, pleomorphic, weakly gram-positive, obligate aerobe.
* The hallmark of all mycobacteria is acid-fastness, which is due to a lipid-rich, waxy cell wall with high mycolic acid content.
* *M. bovis* is the classic zoonotic strain of TB, associated with unpasteurized milk.
* The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is derived from an attenuated strain of *M. bovis*.

#### PATHOGENESIS AND NATURAL HISTORY
* TB transmission occurs via inhalation of airborne droplets smaller than 5 microns.
* The primary immune response to TB involves engulfment of the antigen by alveolar macrophages, transport to hilar lymph nodes, and formation of a granuloma, which is a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction.
* Caseation necrosis refers to the "cheese-like" central cell death that occurs within a TB granuloma.
* The Primary Complex or Ghon Complex of tuberculosis includes the local infection at the portal of entry (parenchymal lung focus) and the draining regional lymph nodes.
* Disseminated TB occurs if the number of circulating bacilli is large and the host's cellular immune response is inadequate.
* A pediatric TB diagnosis acts as a sentinel event indicating recent transmission from an infectious adult, as child-to-child transmission is nearly nonexistent.
* Wallgren’s Timetable predicts when different TB manifestations appear after primary infection.
* According to Wallgren's Timetable, miliary TB and TB meningitis typically develop 2-6 months after primary infection.
* According to Wallgren's Timetable, TB adenitis or endobronchial TB typically develops 3-9 months after primary infection.
* According to Wallgren's Timetable, bone and joint TB typically develops 1 year or more after primary infection.
* According to Wallgren's Timetable, renal TB typically develops 5-25 years after primary infection.
* The three major transitions in the natural history of TB are Exposure, Infection, and Disease.

#### CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS (PULMONARY TB)
* The hallmark of Primary Pulmonary TB in children is the relatively large size of regional lymphadenitis compared with the small size of the initial lung focus.
* The usual radiologic sequence in Primary Pulmonary TB is hilar lymphadenopathy, followed by focal hyperinflation, and then atelectasis.
* Progressive Primary Pulmonary Disease is a rare but serious complication where the primary focus enlarges, develops a caseous center, and liquefies.
* Reactivation TB is rare in young children but can occur in adolescence (often in those >7 years old).
* The most common sites for Reactivation TB are the original parenchymal focus, lymph nodes, or the apical seedings known as Simon Foci.
* The most common radiographic findings in Reactivation TB are extensive infiltrates and thick-walled cavities in the upper lobes.

#### DIAGNOSIS & WORK-UP
* Presumptive TB in a child (<15 years old) is suspected if they present with 3 or more of the following: cough >2 weeks, unexplained fever >2 weeks, failure to respond to antibiotics, failure to regain health post-virus, FTT, or lethargy.
* A person is considered to have TB Exposure or to be a "close contact" if they had prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with an infectious TB patient.
* The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST or PPD) detects a delayed (Type IV) cellular hypersensitivity to TB antigens.
* The "window period" for the TST is 2-12 weeks from exposure to a detectable reaction.
* A TST result is considered positive with an induration of ≥ 5mm in children with a history of close contact, clinical findings of TB, CXR suggestive of TB, or immunocompromised status.
* Sputum collection is recommended for diagnosis in children more than 5 years old or who can expectorate.
* Two sputum specimens should be sent for microscopy: one spot and one early morning, or two specimens collected 1-2 hours apart (front-loading).
* The only contraindication to collecting sputum for DSSM is massive hemoptysis (200-600 ml in 24 hours).
* Gastric washing/aspiration is used for sputum collection in children less than 5 years old or who cannot expectorate.
* When performing gastric washing, KY jelly should not be used as a lubricant because it is bacteriostatic.
* AFB smears of gastric aspirates have low sensitivity, with positive results in fewer than 10% of cases.
* Sputum cultures of gastric aspirate specimens are positive in only 30%-40% of cases.
* Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) should NOT be used for the diagnosis of active pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB; they only indicate TB infection (LTBI).
* The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a fully automated, cartridge-based NAAT that can simultaneously detect TB bacteria and Rifampicin resistance in less than 2 hours.
* For a positive AFB smear, at least 5,000 to 10,000 bacilli per mL are needed, whereas a culture can be positive with only 10-100 organisms.
* The commonest chest radiologic finding in Primary TB is lymphadenopathy.
* Worsening of radiographic findings, such as enlargement of lymph nodes, can be seen in the first 3 months of anti-TB treatment and is not necessarily a sign of failure.
* Miliary (Disseminated) TB on a chest x-ray resembles millet seeds, which are small, uniformly sized nodules distributed throughout the lungs.

#### EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS (EPTB)
* EPTB accounts for 30-40% of pediatric TB cases.
* The most common forms of EPTB in children are lymphatic (adenitis), pleural, and bone TB.
* The most fatal forms of EPTB are pericardial, meningeal, and miliary TB.
* Clues to suspecting EPTB include monoarticular arthritis, persistent sterile pyuria, unexplained pericardial effusion, vertebral osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine, and chronic cervical lymphadenopathy.
* Cervical lymphadenopathy (Scrofula) is the most common form of extrapulmonary TB in children, presenting as painless, firm nodes that become matted.
* If untreated, tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy can rupture through the skin, forming a draining sinus tract known as Scrofuloderma.
* In Cardiac TB, the main finding is pericardial involvement, often with pericardial thickening of >3mm on CT scan.
* TB Meningitis is the most common type of CNS TB and the most common cause of TB-related mortality.
* It is imperative that anti-TB treatment be considered in any child who develops basilar meningitis, hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies, or stroke with no other apparent etiology.
* Communicating hydrocephalus is the most common complication of CNS TB.
* Tuberculomas are intracranial space-occupying lesions that are frequently multiple.
* TB abscesses are typically solitary, larger than tuberculomas, and associated with a more accelerated clinical course.
* TB of the bones and joints is common in young children due to increased blood flow in growing bones.
* TB arthritis is typically monoarticular, most commonly affecting the hip and knee.
* The "Phemister Triad" on radiograph for TB arthritis consists of: juxta-articular osteoporosis, peripherally located osseous erosions, and gradual narrowing of the joint space.
* TB of the Spine (Pott's disease) most commonly affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae.
* A "gibbus" deformity is a characteristic physical exam finding in Pott's disease.
* Peritonitis is the most common clinical manifestation of abdominal TB.
* The ileocecal region is involved in 80-90% of gastrointestinal TB cases.
* The Fleischner sign in GI TB is the thickening of ileocecal valve lips or a wide gaping valve with narrowing of the terminal ileum.
* Disseminated TB is defined as the involvement of two or more organ systems.

#### TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS
* Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) is given for six (6) months to asymptomatic children less than five (5) years old who are household contacts of a confirmed TB case.
* The standard dose for INH in Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) is 10 mg/kg.
* The standard 6-month regimen for new, drug-susceptible TB (pulmonary and most EPTB) is 2 months of HRZE (intensive phase) followed by 4 months of HR (continuation phase).
* Treatment for TB meningitis or TB of the bones and joints is extended to a total of 10-12 months.
* Standard pediatric dosages for first-line anti-TB drugs are: Isoniazid (H) 10 mg/kg, Rifampicin (R) 15 mg/kg, Pyrazinamide (Z) 25-30 mg/kg, and Ethambutol (E) 20 mg/kg.
* A patient with clinically diagnosed TB is considered non-contagious after one week of uninterrupted treatment.
* A patient with bacteriologically confirmed TB is considered non-contagious after a negative follow-up sputum smear microscopy (DSSM).
* Follow-up of treatment response is done with sputum smear microscopy (DSSM), not the Xpert MTB/RIF test, because Xpert cannot differentiate between live and dead bacilli.
* All first-line anti-TB drugs are hepatotoxic, with the relative risk being Pyrazinamide > INH > Rifampicin.
* Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy, which is prevented by co-administering Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6).
* Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis, leading to decreased visual acuity and color blindness.
* Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is defined as an AST level >3x the upper limit of normal with symptoms, or >5x the upper limit without symptoms.
* If a patient on TB treatment develops jaundice, all hepatotoxic drugs must be stopped.
* After DILI resolves (AST <2x ULN), TB drugs are restarted sequentially: Rifampicin first, then INH, then Pyrazinamide.
* Adjunctive steroid therapy (Prednisone) is indicated for TB meningitis, TB pericarditis, endobronchial TB, and severe miliary TB.

#### DRUG-RESISTANT TB
* The Philippines has a high prevalence of Isoniazid (INH) resistance.
* MDR-TB (Multi-Drug Resistant TB) is defined as TB resistant to at least INH and Rifampicin.
* In the Philippines, if a GeneXpert result is "Rifampicin-Resistant," the case is already considered MDR-TB.
* XDR-TB (Extensively Drug-Resistant TB) is MDR-TB with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone AND any second-line injectable agent (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin).
* Suspects for MDR-TB include patients who fail treatment regimens, relapse cases, and contacts of known MDR-TB patients.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS IN TB
* The presentation of TB disease in a child is a significant indicator of recent and ongoing transmission of *M. tuberculosis* within the community.
* Congenital TB is rare. The most common route of TB transmission to a newborn is postnatal airborne transmission from an adult with active pulmonary TB.
* A newborn of a mother with LTBI is not separated at birth and can be given BCG.
* A newborn of a mother with active TB disease should be isolated if the mother has been on anti-TB treatment for less than 2 weeks.

---

### HIGH-YIELD COMPARISONS FOR EXAMS
* **TB Exposure vs. TB Infection (LTBI) vs. TB Disease:**
  - **Exposure:** Contact with a TB case, but has a negative TST, no symptoms, and a normal CXR.
  - **Infection (LTBI):** Has a positive TST (or IGRA) indicating an immune response, but has no symptoms and a normal CXR. The bacteria are dormant.
  - **Disease:** The bacteria are actively multiplying. The patient has symptoms, may have an abnormal CXR, and may have a positive bacteriological test (e.g., sputum smear, Xpert).

* **Primary TB vs. Reactivation TB (in children/adolescents):**
  - **Primary TB:** Occurs shortly after initial infection. The radiographic hallmark in children is prominent hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, often with a small, inconspicuous lung focus (Ghon complex).
  - **Reactivation TB:** Reactivation of a latent infection, more common in adolescents. The classic radiographic finding is upper lobe/apical infiltrates with cavitation.

* **TST/IGRA vs. Xpert MTB/RIF for Diagnosis:**
  - **TST/IGRA:** These are immunologic tests that detect an immune response to *M. tuberculosis*. They CANNOT distinguish between latent infection (LTBI) and active disease.
  - **Xpert MTB/RIF:** This is a molecular test (NAAT) that detects the DNA of the bacteria. It is used to diagnose ACTIVE TB disease and provides rapid information on Rifampicin resistance.

* **Sputum Collection vs. Gastric Washing:**
  - **Sputum Collection:** The preferred method for patients who can voluntarily cough up and expectorate sputum, typically children older than 5 years.
  - **Gastric Washing:** An alternative for infants and young children (<5 years) who cannot expectorate. It involves aspirating swallowed respiratory secretions from the stomach.

* **Cervical Lymphadenopathy (Scrofula) vs. Scrofuloderma:**
  - **Scrofula:** Refers to TB infection of the cervical lymph nodes, presenting as a firm, non-tender mass.
  - **Scrofuloderma:** A complication of untreated scrofula where the infected lymph node caseates, liquefies, and ruptures through the overlying skin, creating a chronic draining sinus tract.

* **Tuberculoma vs. TB Abscess (in CNS):**
  - **Tuberculoma:** A solid or semi-solid mass of caseous material in the brain, often behaving like a tumor. They are frequently multiple.
  - **TB Abscess:** A true liquid pus-filled cavity in the brain. They are typically solitary, larger than tuberculomas, and are associated with a more rapid and severe clinical course.

* **MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB:**
  - **MDR-TB (Multi-Drug Resistant):** Resistant to AT LEAST the two most important first-line drugs: Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RMP).
  - **XDR-TB (Extensively Drug-Resistant):** MDR-TB with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone AND at least one of the three second-line injectable drugs (e.g., amikacin, capreomycin).

* **Child vs. Adult Transmission Dynamics:**
  - **Children:** Typically have paucibacillary (low bacterial load) disease without cavitary lesions, making child-to-child transmission extremely rare.
  - **Adults:** Often have cavitary, multibacillary (high bacterial load) disease, making them the primary source of infection for children and the community.

* **Phemister's Triad vs. Pott's Disease:**
  - **Phemister's Triad:** Radiographic findings for tuberculous arthritis (joint infection), consisting of juxta-articular osteoporosis, peripheral erosions, and gradual joint space narrowing.
  - **Pott's Disease:** Refers specifically to TB of the spine (vertebral infection), which can lead to vertebral collapse and a characteristic "gibbus" deformity.

* **Most Common vs. Most Fatal EPTB:**
  - **Most Common EPTB:** In children, the most frequent forms are Lymphatic (scrofula), Pleural, and Bone/Joint TB.
  - **Most Fatal EPTB:** The forms with the highest mortality are Pericardial, Meningeal (TB Meningitis), and Miliary (Disseminated) TB.

### NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE (GONOCOCCUS)

**General Characteristics & Transmission**
*   Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a nonmotile, aerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-negative intracellular diplococcus.
*   Infection with N. gonorrhoeae only occurs in humans and is shed in the exudate and secretions of infected mucosal surfaces.
*   Transmission of N. gonorrhoeae occurs through sexual contact or during parturition (childbirth).
*   N. gonorrhoeae primarily infects columnar epithelium.

**Clinical Manifestations**
*   In postpubertal males, N. gonorrhoeae infection manifests as urethritis and epididymitis.
*   In postpubertal females, N. gonorrhoeae can cause Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which comprises acute endometritis, salpingitis, and peritonitis.
*   A key sign of gonorrhea is a purulent, pus-like, exudative, and foul-smelling discharge, which carries a risk of infertility.***
*   Perihepatitis, also known as Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, can occur in females from the dissemination of N. gonorrhoeae from the fallopian tubes to the liver capsule.
*   Asymptomatic gonorrhea is common, occurring in 80% of sexually mature females and 20% of males. Most pharyngeal GC infections are also asymptomatic.
*   The primary infection in uncomplicated gonorrhea can present as urethritis, vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, or ophthalmitis, with a hallmark of PURULENT DISCHARGES.***
*   Prepubertal females are predisposed to vulvovaginitis from N. gonorrhoeae due to their thin, noncornified vaginal epithelium and alkaline vaginal pH.
*   In neonates and mature females, the cornification of the vaginal epithelium due to estrogen helps resist N. gonorrhoeae infection.
*   During menses in postpubertal females, decreased bactericidal activity of cervical mucus facilitates the passage of gonococci into the upper reproductive tract, leading to salpingitis.

**Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)**
*   Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI) is the hematogenous spread of N. gonorrhoeae, occurring in 1-3% of cases.
*   Populations at risk for DGI include women (especially menstruating, pregnant, or postpartum), asymptomatic carriers, neonates, homosexuals, and the immunocompromised.
*   DGI presents as two clinical syndromes: Tenosynovitis-dermatitis syndrome and Suppurative arthritis syndrome.
*   The Tenosynovitis-dermatitis syndrome of DGI features prominent systemic signs, polyarthralgia, positive blood cultures (30-40%), and negative synovial fluid cultures.
*   The Suppurative arthritis syndrome of DGI features less prominent systemic signs, monoarticular arthritis, usually negative blood cultures, and positive synovial fluid cultures (45-55%).

**Diagnosis**
*   A presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhea in males can be made by identifying gram-negative intracellular diplococci within leukocytes in a urethral discharge specimen.
*   Specific diagnostic tests for gonorrhea include culture, nucleic acid hybridization tests, and Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT).
*   To differentiate from N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae ferments glucose only, whereas N. meningitidis ferments both glucose and maltose.

**Treatment and Prevention**
*   The drug of choice (DOC) for N. gonorrhoeae infection is Ceftriaxone.
*   For uncomplicated gonorrhea, the treatment is Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg IM as a single dose.
*   For gonococcal bacteremia or arthritis, the treatment is Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg/day for 7 days.
*   For gonococcal meningitis, the treatment duration is 10-14 days for children and above, and 21 days for neonates.
*   For neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, the treatment is Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM single dose, with frequent irrigation of the eyes with normal saline solution.
*   According to lecturer notes, for females with gonorrhea, Doxycycline is often added to the treatment regimen.
*   Alternative drugs for gonorrhea include Cefixime, Ceftizoxime, and Cefotaxime.
*   Prevention of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum involves applying 1% silver nitrate drops, 0.5% Erythromycin ointment, or 1% Tetracycline ointment to the newborn's eyes.

### TREPONEMA PALLIDUM (SYPHILIS)

**General Characteristics & Transmission**
*   Treponema pallidum is a long, motile spirochete that causes syphilis, a chronic, systemic sexually transmitted infection.
*   Acquired syphilis is transmitted almost exclusively by sexual contact, but also via transfusion of contaminated blood or direct contact with infected tissues.
*   Congenital syphilis is transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus via transplacental transmission at any stage of pregnancy.
*   The risk of congenital transmission is highest during the first 4 years of the mother's primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis.
*   Risk factors for congenital syphilis include lack of prenatal care, cocaine abuse, and trading sex for drugs.

**Clinical Manifestations of Acquired Syphilis**
*   Primary Syphilis is characterized by a painless chancre at the site of inoculation plus regional lymphadenitis, appearing after an incubation period of 10-90 days.
*   Secondary Syphilis occurs 2-10 weeks after the chancre heals and is caused by spirochetemia, leading to various skin and systemic manifestations.
*   Latent Syphilis is a seroreactive period with no clinical signs. It is defined as early latent if acquired within the preceding year and late latent if over one year's duration.
*   Tertiary Syphilis occurs 15-30 years after the initial infection and is characterized by neurologic, cardiovascular, and gummatous lesions, which are specific to this stage.

**Clinical Manifestations of Congenital Syphilis**
*   Infants with congenital syphilis are often asymptomatic at birth.
*   Early signs of congenital syphilis (appearing before 2 years of age) include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, increased liver enzymes, and diffuse lymphadenopathy.
*   Late signs of congenital syphilis include:
    *   Hutchinson teeth: Peg-shaped, notched upper central incisors that erupt around the 6th year of life.
    *   Saddle nose: Depression of the nasal root due to destruction of adjacent bone and cartilage.
    *   Saber shins: Anterior bowing of the mid-portion of the tibia.
    *   Rhagades: Linear scars around the mouth, anus, and genitalia.
    *   Other late stigmata include Olympian brow, Clutton joints (painless knee swelling), interstitial keratitis, and 8th nerve deafness.

**Diagnosis**
*   The definitive diagnosis of syphilis is made by demonstrating T. pallidum via darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody testing of specimens from lesions, placenta, or umbilical cord.
*   Presumptive diagnosis uses serologic tests, which are divided into two types:
    *   Nontreponemal tests (VDRL, RPR) are used for screening and monitoring therapy response, as their titers correlate with disease activity. They can produce false-positive results.
    *   Treponemal tests (TPHA, FTA-ABS, TPPA) are used to confirm a diagnosis, as they measure specific antibodies to T. pallidum. They typically remain positive for life and their titers do not correlate with disease activity.
*   For monitoring treatment response, a nontreponemal test like the RPR quantitative is used.
*   In a neonate, an RPR titer that is fourfold higher than the maternal titer is considered a definitive sign of active congenital syphilis infection.

**Treatment**
*   The drug of choice (DOC) for all forms of syphilis is Penicillin. Parenteral Penicillin G is the only documented effective treatment for congenital syphilis, neurosyphilis, and syphilis during pregnancy.
*   The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute systemic febrile reaction that can occur after starting penicillin treatment, caused by the release of antigens from dying spirochetes. It is NOT an indication to discontinue Penicillin.
*   Alternative medications for syphilis mentioned in lecturer notes include Macrolides, Ceftriaxone, and Quinolones.

### CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS

**General Characteristics & Manifestations**
*   Chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of epididymitis and accounts for 23-55% of all cases of nongonococcal urethritis.
*   Up to 75% of women with chlamydial infection are asymptomatic; it is also common for men to be asymptomatic.
*   The characteristic discharge in Chlamydia infection is mucoid, in contrast to the purulent discharge of gonorrhea.
*   Clinical manifestations of Chlamydia include acute urethral syndrome, epididymitis, cervicitis, salpingitis, proctitis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).
*   Perinatally acquired rectal and vaginal Chlamydia infections can persist for 3 years or longer in a child.
*   The detection of C. trachomatis in the vagina or rectum of a young child is NOT absolute evidence of sexual abuse.

**Diagnosis and Complications**
*   The definitive diagnosis of Chlamydia is by isolation in tissue culture or microscopic identification of characteristic "INTRACYTOPLASMIC INCLUSIONS" using fluorescent antibody staining.
*   Other diagnostic tests include Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs), PCR, and GeneXpert.
*   Complications of Chlamydia infection in women include Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, salpingitis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), and secondary infertility or ectopic pregnancy.

**Treatment**
*   For uncomplicated C. trachomatis genital infection in men and non-pregnant women, the recommended treatment is Azithromycin 1 gram PO as a single dose PLUS Doxycycline 100mg PO twice daily for 7 days.
*   For uncomplicated Chlamydia infection in pregnant women, the treatment is Azithromycin 1 gram PO as a single dose OR Amoxicillin 500mg PO three times daily for 7 days.
*   When treating empirically for STIs, it is common to prescribe a regimen that covers both Chlamydia and gonorrhea (e.g., Ceftriaxone plus Azithromycin).
*   Sexual partners of a patient with nongonococcal urethritis from the preceding 60 days should be treated. The most recent sexual partner should always be treated, regardless of last contact.

### PEDIATRIC HIV/AIDS

**Transmission and Prevention**
*   Perinatal (Mother-To-Child-Transmission, MTCT) of HIV can occur antenatally, during delivery, or through breastfeeding.
*   Risk factors for MTCT include high maternal viral load, low maternal CD4 count, vaginal delivery, prolonged rupture of membranes, and breastfeeding.
*   To prevent MTCT, pregnant women should be screened for HIV every trimester.
*   The four principles of HIV transmission are Exit, Sufficient viral load (in blood, breastmilk, semen, vaginal fluid), Survival, and Entry.

**Management of HIV-Exposed Infants**
*   All HIV-exposed infants should receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) starting within 6-12 hours of birth.
*   Infants at low risk (mother on ART for ≥4 weeks) receive a single ARV (e.g., Nevirapine) for 6 weeks (replacement feeding) or 12 weeks (breastfeeding).
*   Infants at high risk (mother untreated, late diagnosis, high viral load) receive a three-drug ARV regimen (e.g., Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine) for 6-12 weeks.
*   The WHO recommends breastfeeding for at least 12 months for infants of HIV-positive mothers on ART, but local guidelines (PIDSP) may recommend formula feeding to eliminate all risk.
*   HIV-exposed infants should start Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis at 6 weeks of age, after ARV prophylaxis is completed and if HIV infection is not confirmed.

**Diagnosis in Infants and Children**
*   For infants from birth to <18 months of age, HIV is diagnosed using a virologic test like RNA PCR or NAAT. The first test is done at 6 weeks of life.
*   For children 18 months of age and older, HIV is diagnosed using an antibody test (e.g., rapid test kit), as maternal antibodies have waned by this age.
*   To be declared HIV-negative, an exposed infant typically requires multiple negative tests, with a final negative antibody test at or after 18 months of age ("graduation").

**Immunization**
*   HIV-exposed and infected children can receive most routine vaccines, including MMR and Varicella if they are not severely immunocompromised.
*   Live vaccines that are CONTRAINDICATED for persons living with HIV (PLHIV) regardless of CD4 count are: BCG, Oral Polio (OPV), Herpes Zoster, Live attenuated influenza vaccine, and Live Typhoid (Ty21a). (Mnemonic: BO HIT).

**Clinical Staging and Treatment (ARV)**
*   The WHO Clinical Staging system is used to classify the severity of HIV disease.
*   Stage 3 HIV disease is marked by conditions like unexplained moderate malnutrition, persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, or pulmonary TB.
*   Stage 4 HIV disease (AIDS) is defined by severe conditions such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, extrapulmonary TB, Kaposi sarcoma, or HIV encephalopathy.
*   Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all persons confirmed to be infected with HIV, regardless of their clinical or immunologic status.
*   The first-line ARV regimen for infants and children <3 years old is typically two NRTIs (e.g., Abacavir + Lamivudine) plus one boosted protease inhibitor (Lopinavir/Ritonavir).
*   The first-line ARV regimen for children 3 to <10 years old is typically two NRTIs (e.g., Abacavir + Lamivudine) plus one NNRTI (Efavirenz).
*   Monitoring for ARV toxicity includes checking serum creatinine for Tenofovir (TDF), CBC for Zidovudine (AZT), and lipid profile for Efavirenz (EFV) and protease inhibitors.
*   Treatment failure is defined as a plasma viral load above 1,000 copies/mL at any time beyond 6 months of starting effective ART.

### High-Yield Comparisons

*   **Gonorrhea vs. Chlamydia Discharge:** The discharge in Gonorrhea is typically purulent and thick, while the discharge in Chlamydia is more often mucoid or watery.
*   **Syphilis Chancre vs. Chancroid:** The chancre of primary syphilis (T. pallidum) is typically single, firm, and painless. The chancroid of H. ducreyi is typically multiple, soft, and painful with associated tender lymphadenopathy.
*   **Syphilis Serology (Nontreponemal vs. Treponemal):** Nontreponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) are for screening and monitoring treatment response. Treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, TPPA) are for confirming a diagnosis and remain positive for life.
*   **Disseminated Gonorrhea Syndromes:** The Tenosynovitis-dermatitis syndrome presents with polyarthralgia and is often blood culture positive. The Suppurative Arthritis syndrome presents as a monoarticular septic arthritis and is often synovial fluid culture positive.
*   **HIV Testing in Infants vs. Older Children:** Infants (<18 months) must be tested with a virologic test (PCR/NAT) to detect the virus itself. Older children (>18 months) can be tested with an antibody test.
*   **Infant HIV Prophylaxis (Low vs. High Risk):** Low-risk infants (mother virally suppressed on ART) receive single-drug prophylaxis (Nevirapine). High-risk infants (mother untreated or with high viral load) receive triple-drug prophylaxis.
*   **Permitted vs. Contraindicated Vaccines in HIV:** Most inactivated vaccines are permitted. Live vaccines like BCG, Oral Polio, and live influenza are contraindicated in persons living with HIV.
*   **Differentiating N. gonorrhoeae vs. N. meningitidis:** N. gonorrhoeae ferments only glucose. N. meningitidis ferments both glucose and maltose.
*   **Congenital Syphilis (Early vs. Late):** Early signs (<2 years) include hepatosplenomegaly and rhinitis ("snuffles"). Late signs (>2 years) are the permanent stigmata like Hutchinson teeth, saddle nose, and saber shins.
*   **Treatment of Empiric Urethritis/Cervicitis:** A common approach is to treat for both Gonorrhea and Chlamydia simultaneously, using a regimen like single-dose IM Ceftriaxone plus oral Azithromycin. Doxycycline is often added for females.
*   **Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction:** This is an acute febrile reaction after starting antibiotic treatment for spirochetal infections like Syphilis. It is caused by toxin release from dying organisms and is NOT a drug allergy; treatment should be continued.
*   **WHO HIV Stage 3 vs. Stage 4:** The presence of Tuberculosis (TB) places a patient in Stage 3. The presence of more severe opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or CNS toxoplasmosis defines Stage 4 (AIDS).
*   **Monitoring ARV Side Effects:** Remember to monitor CBC for Zidovudine (AZT) due to bone marrow suppression, renal function (creatinine) for Tenofovir (TDF), and lipids/glucose for protease inhibitors (e.g., Lopinavir/ritonavir).

### FUNGAL INFECTIONS

#### CANDIDA
- **Candida - General:** *Candida* are members of the normal flora of humans and colonize mucosal surfaces soon after birth, posing a risk of endogenous infection.
- **Candida - Species:** While the *Candida* genus has over 314 species, fewer than 20 cause candidiasis.
- **Candida - Prevalence:** Candidiasis is the most prevalent systemic mycosis.
- **Candida - Common Agents:** The five most common causative agents of candidiasis are *C. albicans*, *C. parapsilosis*, *C. glabrata*, *C. tropicalis*, and *C. krusei*.

#### Candida albicans
- **C. albicans - Pathogenesis:** *C. albicans* exists as a commensal but can convert to a pathogen depending on the host's immune or endocrine status.
- **C. albicans - Morphology:** *C. albicans* is polymorphic, growing as budding yeast cells, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae. It is Gram-positive and 10-12 μm in diameter.
- **C. albicans - Genetic Control:** The transcription repressor **NRg1** is needed for *C. albicans* to maintain its yeast form.
- **C. albicans - Identification:** Production of germ tubes and terminal chlamydospores are key characteristics used to identify *C. albicans* in the laboratory.
- **Germ Tube Test - Principle:** The germ tube test is a rapid presumptive identification for *C. albicans*, as germ tube formation is associated with increased protein and RNA synthesis.
- **Germ Tube Test - Positive Result:** A positive test shows a short hyphal extension arising from a yeast cell with no constriction at the point of origin. Examples include *Candida albicans* and *Candida dubliniensis*.
- **Germ Tube Test - Negative Result:** A negative test shows no hyphal extension or an extension that is constricted at the origin. Examples include *C. tropicalis* and *C. glabrata*.

#### Candidiasis
- **Candidiasis - Risk Factors (Non-Neutropenic):** Risk factors for invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients include anatomical disruption (surgery, wounds, burns), ICU stays, intravascular catheters, TPN, and antibiotic use (especially for >7 days).
- **Candidiasis - Risk Factors (Neutropenic):** Risk factors for invasive candidiasis in neutropenic cancer patients include mucosal ulceration, intravascular catheters, and cytotoxic/immunosuppressive drugs.
- **Candidiasis - Community Risk Factors:** Community risk factors for invasive candidiasis include hemodialysis and diabetes.
- **Invasive Candidiasis - Clinical Forms:** Other clinical forms of invasive candidiasis include Bone & Joint, Chronic Hepatosplenic, Endocarditis, Endophthalmitis, Renal, Skin lesions, CNS infection, Peritonitis, and UTI.
- **Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis:** This is a rare form of candidiasis caused by a genetic defect in T-cell responsiveness to *Candida*.

#### Candida Diagnosis & Treatment
- **Candida - Diagnosis:** Diagnosis of *Candida* relies on morphology on Gram stain, culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, and biochemical tests (like API) for speciation.
- **Candida Speciation - Importance:** Speciation of *Candida* is important due to significant antifungal resistance among different species.
- **Oral Candidiasis - Treatment (Adults):** Mild oral candidiasis in adults is treated with clotrimazole troches or miconazole buccal tablets; moderate to severe forms require oral Fluconazole.
- **Oral Candidiasis - Treatment (Infants):** Oral thrush in infants is treated with oral miconazole or Nystatin solution. Immunocompromised children may require oral fluconazole.
- **Esophageal Candidiasis - Treatment:** Esophageal candidiasis is treated with oral fluconazole. Refractory cases may require Itraconazole or Voriconazole.
- **Candidemia/Invasive Candidiasis - Treatment Principle:** A crucial step in treating candidemia is to **remove the central venous catheter**, as drug therapy alone is not sufficient.
- **Candidemia - Treatment (Non-Neutropenic):** The drug of choice for candidemia in non-neutropenic patients is an echinocandin (e.g., micafungin, caspofungin). Fluconazole is an alternative.
- **Candidemia - Treatment (Neutropenic):** The drug of choice for candidemia in neutropenic patients is an echinocandin. Alternatives include Amphotericin B (lipid formulation preferred).
- **Emerging Candida - *C. auris*:** *Candida auris* is an emerging pathogen that is often multidrug-resistant (especially to fluconazole and amphotericin B) and has caused healthcare-associated outbreaks.
- **Emerging Candida - *C. krusei*:** *Candida krusei* (now *Pichia kudriavzevii*) is of concern due to its relative intrinsic resistance to azoles and other antifungal drugs.

#### CRYPTOCOCCOSIS
- **Cryptococcosis - General:** Cryptococcosis is a subacute or chronic infection, most often involving the CNS, and is considered an AIDS-defining illness.
- **Cryptococcus Varieties - Comparison:**
    - ***C. neoformans*:** Has a worldwide distribution, is found in pigeon feces, and primarily infects immunocompromised hosts (AIDS). It is the most common cause of cryptococcosis.
    - ***C. gattii*:** Found in tropical/subtropical regions, associated with Eucalyptus trees, can infect normal hosts, and is associated with cryptococcomas and higher mortality.
- **Cryptococcus - Pathogenesis:** Infection occurs via inhalation of particles. A primary pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic but can disseminate, with the **CNS being the most common site of dissemination**.
- **Cryptococcosis - Most Common Infection Site:** The most common initial site of infection in cryptococcosis is the lungs (pulmonary infection).
- **Cryptococcosis - Laboratory Diagnosis:** The hallmark of diagnosis is the **India Ink mount** of CSF, which reveals the encapsulated yeast as a halo.
- **Cryptococcosis - Culture:** When grown on Niger seed agar or with caffeic acid, *C. neoformans* and *C. gattii* produce a characteristic **brown colony effect**.
- **Cryptococcosis - Histopathology:** The **Mucicarmine stain** is used in histopathology to stain the capsule of *Cryptococcus* red.
- **Severe Cryptococcosis - Treatment Phases:** Treatment for severe cryptococcosis is triphasic:
    1.  **Induction:** Amphotericin B + flucytosine for ~2 weeks.
    2.  **Consolidation:** High-dose fluconazole for ~8 weeks.
    3.  **Maintenance:** Lower-dose fluconazole for ≥6-12 months.

#### SUPERFICIAL & CUTANEOUS MYCOSES

- **Superficial Mycoses - Types:**
    1.  **Pityriasis (Tinea) Versicolor:** Caused by *Malassezia* species, resulting in hypo- or hyper-pigmented skin patches.
    2.  **White Piedra:** Soft, beige nodules on hair shafts caused by *Trichosporon* species.
    3.  **Black Piedra:** Firm, black nodules on the hair shaft caused by *Piedraia hortae*.
    4.  **Tinea Nigra:** Brown to black stain on the palm or sole caused by *Hortaea werneckii*.
- **Cutaneous Mycoses (Dermatophytes):** These fungi are confined to the non-living outer layers of skin, hair, and nails, and produce keratinases.
- **Dermatophyte Diagnosis - KOH Prep:** A skin scraping with KOH preparation is the fastest and simplest diagnostic test for dermatophytes.
- **Dermatophyte Genera - Infection Sites:**
    - ***Trichophyton*:** Infects skin, hair, and nails ("Tri" for all three).
    - ***Microsporum*:** Infects hair and skin (not nails).

- ***Epidermophyton floccosum*:** Characterized by the **absence of microconidia** and the presence of multiple smooth, club-shaped macroconidia, often in clusters.
- **Tinea Capitis - Favus:** A severe form of tinea capitis characterized by a **scutulum** (yellow, cup-shaped crust) and often caused by *T. schoenleinii*.
- **Tinea Cruris (Jock Itch):** An infection of the groin area where the **scrotum and penis are typically spared**.
- **Tinea Unguium (Onychomycosis):** A dermatophyte infection of the nail, frequently caused by *T. rubrum*, that is often resistant to topical antifungal agents.
- **Tinea Pedis - Moccasin Type:** Presents as chronic plantar erythema and hyperkeratosis in a **moccasin-like distribution**, often associated with the “two feet, one hand” presentation.
- ***Malassezia* - Microscopy:** In skin scrapings, *Malassezia* species classically show clusters of thick-walled blastospores and hyphae, known as the **“spaghetti-and-meatballs appearance.”**
- ***Malassezia* - Associated Conditions:**
    - **Tinea Versicolor:** *M. globosa, M. sympodialis, M. restricta, M. furfur*.
    - **Neonatal Acne:** *M. sympodialis, M. globosa*.
    - **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** *M. globosa, M. restricta*.
- **Onychomycosis - Treatment:** Oral therapy (e.g., Terbinafine) is more effective than topical therapy due to the nail plate barrier. LASER therapy offers "temporary cosmetic improvement" but is not a fungicidal therapy.

#### FILAMENTOUS FUNGI

- ***Capillaria philippinensis* - Egg Morphology:** Eggs are peanut-shaped with flattened bipolar plugs, resembling *Trichuris* eggs but broader.
- ***Ascaris lumbricoides* (Roundworm) - Life Cycle:** Involves ingestion of embryonated eggs and a larval migration phase through the lungs, which can cause pneumonitis.
- **Hookworm - Transmission:** Infection occurs when **filariform larvae** in soil penetrate intact skin, often on the feet ("ground itch").
- **Hookworm vs. Strongyloides Larva:** In the rhabditiform stage, the hookworm larva has a **long buccal cavity**, whereas the *Strongyloides* larva has a **short buccal cavity**.

- **Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) - Pathology:** The most severe inflammation and lymphatic damage is elicited by **dead or dying adult worms**, leading to obstruction.
- **Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) - Chronic Manifestations:** Chronic disease can lead to **lymphedema**, **elephantiasis** (most commonly in lower extremities), and **hydrocele**.
- **Hydrocele in LF:** Hydrocele (fluid-filled sac around the testes) is the most common chronic manifestation of **bancroftian filariasis** (*W. bancrofti*).
- **Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) - Diagnosis:** The **gold standard** for diagnosis is the detection of **circulating filarial antigen (CFA)** using a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT), which can be done anytime.
- **Microfilariae - Blood Collection:** For microscopic diagnosis of *W. bancrofti* (nocturnal periodicity), blood should be collected between **8 PM and 4 AM**.
- **Microfilariae - Differentiation (*W. bancrofti* vs. *B. malayi*):**
    - ***W. bancrofti*:** Nuclei **do not** extend to the tail tip; sheath is unstained with Giemsa.
    - ***B. malayi*:** Nuclei **do** extend to the tail tip (has terminal/subterminal nuclei); sheath stains pink with Giemsa.
- **Lymphatic Filariasis - Management:** Management of elephantiasis is supportive, focusing on meticulous hygiene (washing affected parts), elevation, and exercise to prevent secondary bacterial infections.

### Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) and Disease (GERD)

#### Overview and Comparison
| Feature | Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) | Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Physiologic retrograde movement of gastric contents across the LES into the esophagus. | Pathologic reflux associated with troublesome symptoms or complications. |
| **Complications** | None; usually considered "physiologic." | Esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's esophagus, failure to thrive. |
| **Effort** | Effortless passage of contents (spitting up). | May involve forceful passage or associated distress. |

* **Epidemiology of GERD**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is the <b style="color:red">most common esophageal disorder</b> in children, with an increasing incidence linked to Western diets and high fatty food intake.
* **GERD Pathophysiology**: <b style="color:red">Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR)</b> is the major mechanism of pathologic reflux; it is not related to swallowing and increases with gastric distention.
* **GERD Barriers**: Reflux can be caused by a <b style="color:red">defective anti-reflux barrier</b>, which includes the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the crural diaphragm, or the presence of a hiatal hernia.
* **GERD Clearance Factors**: Diminished esophageal clearance, affected by poor peristalsis, supine body position, or lack of saliva (xerostomia), contributes to the development of GERD.
* **GERD External Triggers**: High-fat diets, smoking (nicotine relaxes the LES), and medications like <b style="color:red">ACE inhibitors or Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)</b> can exacerbate reflux.
* **Natural History of GER**: Infantile reflux peaks at <b style="color:red">4 months of age</b> and resolves in 88% of cases by 12 months; infants are often called "happy spitters" if they are active and feeding well despite reflux.
* **Sandifer Syndrome**: A unique clinical manifestation of GERD in infants characterized by <b style="color:red">neck contortions and arching</b> (resembling opisthotonus) often associated with food refusal.
* **Infantile GERD Symptoms**: Manifestations include irritability, arching, choking, gagging, feeding aversion, and <b style="color:red">failure to thrive</b>.
* **Older Children GERD Symptoms**: Presentations typically include <b style="color:red">heartburn, chest pain</b>, abdominal pain, and sometimes difficult-to-treat asthma or chronic cough.
* **GERD Diagnosis**: GERD is primarily a <b style="color:red">clinical diagnosis</b> based on history and physical examination; an empirical trial of PPI therapy for 2-4 weeks can confirm the diagnosis in <b style="color:red">older children and adults only</b>.
* **Diagnostic Imaging in Vomiting**: Barium swallow can identify structural abnormalities such as achalasia (showing a <b style="color:red">"bird’s beak"</b> appearance) but is not used to diagnose GERD itself.
* **Nonpharmacologic Management of GERD**: Strategies include avoiding overfeeding, thickening feeds, using hydrolyzed protein formula if allergy is suspected, and maintaining an upright position after feeds.
* **Pharmacologic Management of GERD**: <b style="color:red">Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</b> like omeprazole are the only acid suppressants recommended for long-term treatment; H2RAs are not for chronic use, and prokinetics (e.g., domperidone) are generally discouraged.

### Gastrointestinal Infections and Acute Gastroenteritis

#### Pathogenesis of Diarrhea
| Type | Mechanism | Common Pathogens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Noninflammatory** | Enterotoxin production or villus destruction; no WBC/RBC in stool. | Rotavirus, Vibrio cholerae, ETEC. |
| **Inflammatory** | Direct mucosal invasion or cytotoxin production; results in bloody stools. | Shigella, Salmonella, E. histolytica, EIEC. |
| **Penetrating** | Invasion beyond the intestinal epithelium. | Nontyphoidal Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter. |

* **Global Impact**: Diarrhea is the <b style="color:red">top three cause of mortality</b> in children under 5 years worldwide, particularly in low- to middle-income countries.
* **Etiology of Gastroenteritis**: <b style="color:red">Viruses</b> are the most common etiologic group, with <b style="color:red">Rotavirus</b> being the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children.
* **Transmission**: The primary route for GI infections is <b style="color:red">fecal-oral transmission</b> via contaminated water, food, or person-to-person contact.
* **Clinical Manifestation**: <b style="color:red">Dehydration</b> is the most common manifestation of acute gastroenteritis and is the priority for clinical assessment.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - Reactive Arthritis**: Patients may develop knee pain and joint inflammation 1-3 weeks after an infection with <b style="color:red">Salmonella or Shigella</b>.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - Guillain-Barre Syndrome**: A neurological complication occurring a few weeks after a <b style="color:red">Campylobacter</b> infection.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - HUS**: <b style="color:red">Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome</b> presents with sudden onset renal failure following infection with <b style="color:red">Shigella dysenteriae 1 or E. coli O157:H7</b>.
* **Management - Rehydration**: Rehydration therapy is the mainstay of treatment, using <b style="color:red">Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)</b> for mild cases and IV fluids for severe shock.
* **Management - Zinc Supplementation**: Zinc is recommended as a mainstay treatment to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea episodes.
* **Prevention**: Strategies include <b style="color:red">Rotavirus vaccination</b>, breastfeeding for up to 2 years, handwashing, and improved sanitation.

### Functional Constipation and Encopresis

#### Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria (Must meet 2 or more for at least 1 month)
| Criteria | Child & Adolescent (≥4 years) | Neonate & Toddler (<4 years) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | ≤2 defecations per week. | ≤2 defecations per week. |
| **Incontinence** | At least 1 episode of fecal incontinence/week. | At least 1 episode/week after toilet training. |
| **Posturing** | History of retentive posturing/volitional retention. | History of excessive stool retention. |
| **Pain** | History of painful or hard bowel movements. | History of painful or hard bowel movements. |
| **Mass** | Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum. | Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum. |
| **Diameter** | History of large diameter stools. | History of large diameter stools. |

* **Definition of Encopresis**: The <b style="color:red">involuntary loss</b> of stools into underwear after a child has reached the developmental age of <b style="color:red">4 years</b>.
* **Timing of Constipation**: Constitutional or functional constipation often starts around <b style="color:red">6 months of age</b> with the introduction of complementary feeding; onset <6 months suggests organic causes like <b style="color:red">Hirschsprung Disease</b>.
* **Alarm Signs of Hirschsprung Disease**: 1) Onset in first month of life, 2) Meconium passage <b style="color:red">>48 hours</b>, 3) Family history of HD, and 4) <b style="color:red">Ribbon stools</b>.
* **Neurologic Alarm Signs**: The presence of a <b style="color:red">tuft of hair on the spine</b>, sacral dimple, or gluteal cleft deviation may indicate a neurologic cause for constipation.
* **Physical Exam Findings**: Palpation often reveals a hard fecal mass in the <b style="color:red">left lower quadrant</b> of the abdomen.
* **Pharmacologic Management - Disimpaction**: The first step of treatment is removing the stool ball via <b style="color:red">Glycerin suppositories</b> (infants) or <b style="color:red">Phosphate enemas</b> (older children); oral PEG can also be used for "slow" disimpaction.
* **Pharmacologic Management - Maintenance**: Once disimpacted, patients require weeks to months of maintenance laxatives (e.g., <b style="color:red">Lactulose or Polyethylene glycol</b>) to prevent recurrence.
* **Toilet Training Position**: Proper positioning involves knees higher than hips, leaning forward with elbows on knees, and feet well-supported (not "frog" position).

### Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)

#### Classification of Ulcers
| Type | Common Location | Primary Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary PUD** | Duodenum (Duodenal bulb). | <b style="color:red">Helicobacter pylori</b> infection. |
| **Secondary PUD** | Stomach (Gastric, lesser curvature). | NSAIDs, Stress (sepsis/shock), burns, or intracranial lesions. |

* **Secondary Ulcer Eponyms**: <b style="color:red">Cushing Ulcer</b> is associated with intracranial lesions; <b style="color:red">Curling Ulcer</b> is associated with severe burn injuries.
* **PUD Pathogenesis**: Disease results from an imbalance where <b style="color:red">damaging factors</b> (acid, pepsin, NSAIDs, H. pylori) outweigh <b style="color:red">defensive mechanisms</b> (mucus, bicarbonate, prostaglandins).
* **Clinical Presentation of PUD**: The classic symptom is <b style="color:red">epigastric pain</b> that is dull or aching and often <b style="color:red">alleviated by ingestion of food</b>.
* **PUD in Infants**: Infants may present with non-specific symptoms such as irritability, vomiting, feeding difficulty, or <b style="color:red">hematemesis</b>.
* **Gold Standard Diagnosis**: <b style="color:red">Upper Endoscopy (EGD)</b> is the preferred diagnostic tool to visualize the ulcer, perform a biopsy, and screen for H. pylori.
* **H. pylori Triple Therapy**: Treatment consists of <b style="color:red">one month of a PPI</b> combined with <b style="color:red">two antibiotics</b> (e.g., Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin or Metronidazole) for 14 days.
* **Surgical Indications**: Surgery is reserved for complications such as <b style="color:red">uncontrollable bleeding, perforation, or obstruction</b>.

### Critical Comparisons and Differential Diagnoses

* **GER vs. GERD**: GER is a normal physiologic process ("happy spitter"), while GERD involves pathologic symptoms, complications, or failure to thrive.
* **Vomiting vs. Reflux**: Vomiting is a <b style="color:red">forceful</b> passage of gastric contents; Reflux is an <b style="color:red">effortless</b> passage.
* **Classic PUD vs. GERD Pain**: PUD pain is typically <b style="color:red">epigastric</b> and relieved by food; GERD pain is often described as <b style="color:red">retrosternal/heartburn</b> and may worsen after eating.
* **Primary vs. Secondary PUD**: Primary PUD is usually <b style="color:red">duodenal</b> and H. pylori-related; secondary PUD is usually <b style="color:red">gastric</b> and related to acute stress or drugs.
* **Cushing vs. Curling Ulcer**: Cushing ulcers are triggered by <b style="color:red">CNS/intracranial injury</b>; Curling ulcers are triggered by <b style="color:red">severe burns</b>.
* **Non-inflammatory vs. Inflammatory Diarrhea**: Non-inflammatory diarrhea is watery (toxin-mediated, no blood); inflammatory diarrhea is often <b style="color:red">bloody (dysentery)</b> due to mucosal invasion.
* **Functional Constipation vs. Hirschsprung Disease**: Functional constipation usually starts at <b style="color:red">6 months</b> (dietary change) and has stools in the rectal vault; Hirschsprung presents <b style="color:red">at birth</b> with delayed meconium and an empty rectum on exam.
* **Encopresis vs. Diarrhea**: Encopresis is the leakage of stool around a <b style="color:red">fecal impaction</b> in a constipated child; diarrhea is an increase in stool frequency and liquidity without impaction.
* **PPIs vs. H2RAs in GERD**: PPIs (e.g., Omeprazole) are used for <b style="color:red">long-term management</b>; H2RAs (e.g., Ranitidine) are not recommended for chronic GERD treatment.
* **Projectile vs. Non-projectile Vomiting**: Projectile vomiting suggests <b style="color:red">Increased ICP or Pyloric Stenosis</b>; non-projectile vomiting is more common in GERD or Gastroenteritis.
* **Bilious vs. Bloody Vomitus**: Bilious vomiting (green) indicates obstruction <b style="color:red">distal to the ampulla of Vater</b>; bloody vomiting (hematemesis) indicates gastritis, ulcers, or esophagitis.
* **Achalasia vs. Pyloric Stenosis Imaging**: Achalasia shows a <b style="color:red">"bird's beak"</b> on barium swallow; Pyloric stenosis is typically diagnosed via <b style="color:red">ultrasound</b> (thickened pylorus).
* **Reactive Arthritis vs. Sepsis**: Reactive arthritis is a <b style="color:red">post-infectious</b> (1-3 weeks later) joint pain; sepsis is an acute, systemic inflammatory response during the active infection.
* **Lactulose vs. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)**: Both are osmotic laxatives used for <b style="color:red">maintenance</b> in constipation; PEG is often used for both rapid disimpaction and maintenance.
* **Sandifer Syndrome vs. Seizures**: Sandifer syndrome involves arching and neck posturing <b style="color:red">temporally related to feeding</b> (reflux-induced); seizures are generally not related to meals.

### Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) and Disease (GERD)

#### Overview and Comparison
| Feature | Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) | Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Physiologic retrograde movement of gastric contents across the LES into the esophagus. | Pathologic reflux associated with troublesome symptoms or complications. |
| **Complications** | None; usually considered "physiologic." | Esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's esophagus, failure to thrive. |
| **Effort** | Effortless passage of contents (spitting up). | May involve forceful passage or associated distress. |

* **Epidemiology of GERD**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is the <b style="color:red">most common esophageal disorder</b> in children, with an increasing incidence linked to Western diets and high fatty food intake.
* **GERD Pathophysiology**: <b style="color:red">Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR)</b> is the major mechanism of pathologic reflux; it is not related to swallowing and increases with gastric distention.
* **GERD Barriers**: Reflux can be caused by a <b style="color:red">defective anti-reflux barrier</b>, which includes the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the crural diaphragm, or the presence of a hiatal hernia.
* **GERD Clearance Factors**: Diminished esophageal clearance, affected by poor peristalsis, supine body position, or lack of saliva (xerostomia), contributes to the development of GERD.
* **GERD External Triggers**: High-fat diets, smoking (nicotine relaxes the LES), and medications like <b style="color:red">ACE inhibitors or Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)</b> can exacerbate reflux.
* **Natural History of GER**: Infantile reflux peaks at <b style="color:red">4 months of age</b> and resolves in 88% of cases by 12 months; infants are often called "happy spitters" if they are active and feeding well despite reflux.
* **Sandifer Syndrome**: A unique clinical manifestation of GERD in infants characterized by <b style="color:red">neck contortions and arching</b> (resembling opisthotonus) often associated with food refusal.
* **Infantile GERD Symptoms**: Manifestations include irritability, arching, choking, gagging, feeding aversion, and <b style="color:red">failure to thrive</b>.
* **Older Children GERD Symptoms**: Presentations typically include <b style="color:red">heartburn, chest pain</b>, abdominal pain, and sometimes difficult-to-treat asthma or chronic cough.
* **GERD Diagnosis**: GERD is primarily a <b style="color:red">clinical diagnosis</b> based on history and physical examination; an empirical trial of PPI therapy for 2-4 weeks can confirm the diagnosis in <b style="color:red">older children and adults only</b>.
* **Diagnostic Imaging in Vomiting**: Barium swallow can identify structural abnormalities such as achalasia (showing a <b style="color:red">"bird’s beak"</b> appearance) but is not used to diagnose GERD itself.
* **Nonpharmacologic Management of GERD**: Strategies include avoiding overfeeding, thickening feeds, using hydrolyzed protein formula if allergy is suspected, and maintaining an upright position after feeds.
* **Pharmacologic Management of GERD**: <b style="color:red">Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</b> like omeprazole are the only acid suppressants recommended for long-term treatment; H2RAs are not for chronic use, and prokinetics (e.g., domperidone) are generally discouraged.

### Gastrointestinal Infections and Acute Gastroenteritis

#### Pathogenesis of Diarrhea
| Type | Mechanism | Common Pathogens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Noninflammatory** | Enterotoxin production or villus destruction; no WBC/RBC in stool. | Rotavirus, Vibrio cholerae, ETEC. |
| **Inflammatory** | Direct mucosal invasion or cytotoxin production; results in bloody stools. | Shigella, Salmonella, E. histolytica, EIEC. |
| **Penetrating** | Invasion beyond the intestinal epithelium. | Nontyphoidal Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter. |

* **Global Impact**: Diarrhea is the <b style="color:red">top three cause of mortality</b> in children under 5 years worldwide, particularly in low- to middle-income countries.
* **Etiology of Gastroenteritis**: <b style="color:red">Viruses</b> are the most common etiologic group, with <b style="color:red">Rotavirus</b> being the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children.
* **Transmission**: The primary route for GI infections is <b style="color:red">fecal-oral transmission</b> via contaminated water, food, or person-to-person contact.
* **Clinical Manifestation**: <b style="color:red">Dehydration</b> is the most common manifestation of acute gastroenteritis and is the priority for clinical assessment.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - Reactive Arthritis**: Patients may develop knee pain and joint inflammation 1-3 weeks after an infection with <b style="color:red">Salmonella or Shigella</b>.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - Guillain-Barre Syndrome**: A neurological complication occurring a few weeks after a <b style="color:red">Campylobacter</b> infection.
* **Extraintestinal Complication - HUS**: <b style="color:red">Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome</b> presents with sudden onset renal failure following infection with <b style="color:red">Shigella dysenteriae 1 or E. coli O157:H7</b>.
* **Management - Rehydration**: Rehydration therapy is the mainstay of treatment, using <b style="color:red">Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)</b> for mild cases and IV fluids for severe shock.
* **Management - Zinc Supplementation**: Zinc is recommended as a mainstay treatment to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea episodes.
* **Prevention**: Strategies include <b style="color:red">Rotavirus vaccination</b>, breastfeeding for up to 2 years, handwashing, and improved sanitation.

### Functional Constipation and Encopresis

#### Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria (Must meet 2 or more for at least 1 month)
| Criteria | Child & Adolescent (≥4 years) | Neonate & Toddler (<4 years) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | ≤2 defecations per week. | ≤2 defecations per week. |
| **Incontinence** | At least 1 episode of fecal incontinence/week. | At least 1 episode/week after toilet training. |
| **Posturing** | History of retentive posturing/volitional retention. | History of excessive stool retention. |
| **Pain** | History of painful or hard bowel movements. | History of painful or hard bowel movements. |
| **Mass** | Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum. | Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum. |
| **Diameter** | History of large diameter stools. | History of large diameter stools. |

* **Definition of Encopresis**: The <b style="color:red">involuntary loss</b> of stools into underwear after a child has reached the developmental age of <b style="color:red">4 years</b>.
* **Timing of Constipation**: Constitutional or functional constipation often starts around <b style="color:red">6 months of age</b> with the introduction of complementary feeding; onset <6 months suggests organic causes like <b style="color:red">Hirschsprung Disease</b>.
* **Alarm Signs of Hirschsprung Disease**: 1) Onset in first month of life, 2) Meconium passage <b style="color:red">>48 hours</b>, 3) Family history of HD, and 4) <b style="color:red">Ribbon stools</b>.
* **Neurologic Alarm Signs**: The presence of a <b style="color:red">tuft of hair on the spine</b>, sacral dimple, or gluteal cleft deviation may indicate a neurologic cause for constipation.
* **Physical Exam Findings**: Palpation often reveals a hard fecal mass in the <b style="color:red">left lower quadrant</b> of the abdomen.
* **Pharmacologic Management - Disimpaction**: The first step of treatment is removing the stool ball via <b style="color:red">Glycerin suppositories</b> (infants) or <b style="color:red">Phosphate enemas</b> (older children); oral PEG can also be used for "slow" disimpaction.
* **Pharmacologic Management - Maintenance**: Once disimpacted, patients require weeks to months of maintenance laxatives (e.g., <b style="color:red">Lactulose or Polyethylene glycol</b>) to prevent recurrence.
* **Toilet Training Position**: Proper positioning involves knees higher than hips, leaning forward with elbows on knees, and feet well-supported (not "frog" position).

### Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)

#### Classification of Ulcers
| Type | Common Location | Primary Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary PUD** | Duodenum (Duodenal bulb). | <b style="color:red">Helicobacter pylori</b> infection. |
| **Secondary PUD** | Stomach (Gastric, lesser curvature). | NSAIDs, Stress (sepsis/shock), burns, or intracranial lesions. |

* **Secondary Ulcer Eponyms**: <b style="color:red">Cushing Ulcer</b> is associated with intracranial lesions; <b style="color:red">Curling Ulcer</b> is associated with severe burn injuries.
* **PUD Pathogenesis**: Disease results from an imbalance where <b style="color:red">damaging factors</b> (acid, pepsin, NSAIDs, H. pylori) outweigh <b style="color:red">defensive mechanisms</b> (mucus, bicarbonate, prostaglandins).
* **Clinical Presentation of PUD**: The classic symptom is <b style="color:red">epigastric pain</b> that is dull or aching and often <b style="color:red">alleviated by ingestion of food</b>.
* **PUD in Infants**: Infants may present with non-specific symptoms such as irritability, vomiting, feeding difficulty, or <b style="color:red">hematemesis</b>.
* **Gold Standard Diagnosis**: <b style="color:red">Upper Endoscopy (EGD)</b> is the preferred diagnostic tool to visualize the ulcer, perform a biopsy, and screen for H. pylori.
* **H. pylori Triple Therapy**: Treatment consists of <b style="color:red">one month of a PPI</b> combined with <b style="color:red">two antibiotics</b> (e.g., Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin or Metronidazole) for 14 days.
* **Surgical Indications**: Surgery is reserved for complications such as <b style="color:red">uncontrollable bleeding, perforation, or obstruction</b>.

### Critical Comparisons and Differential Diagnoses

* **GER vs. GERD**: GER is a normal physiologic process ("happy spitter"), while GERD involves pathologic symptoms, complications, or failure to thrive.
* **Vomiting vs. Reflux**: Vomiting is a <b style="color:red">forceful</b> passage of gastric contents; Reflux is an <b style="color:red">effortless</b> passage.
* **Classic PUD vs. GERD Pain**: PUD pain is typically <b style="color:red">epigastric</b> and relieved by food; GERD pain is often described as <b style="color:red">retrosternal/heartburn</b> and may worsen after eating.
* **Primary vs. Secondary PUD**: Primary PUD is usually <b style="color:red">duodenal</b> and H. pylori-related; secondary PUD is usually <b style="color:red">gastric</b> and related to acute stress or drugs.
* **Cushing vs. Curling Ulcer**: Cushing ulcers are triggered by <b style="color:red">CNS/intracranial injury</b>; Curling ulcers are triggered by <b style="color:red">severe burns</b>.
* **Non-inflammatory vs. Inflammatory Diarrhea**: Non-inflammatory diarrhea is watery (toxin-mediated, no blood); inflammatory diarrhea is often <b style="color:red">bloody (dysentery)</b> due to mucosal invasion.
* **Functional Constipation vs. Hirschsprung Disease**: Functional constipation usually starts at <b style="color:red">6 months</b> (dietary change) and has stools in the rectal vault; Hirschsprung presents <b style="color:red">at birth</b> with delayed meconium and an empty rectum on exam.
* **Encopresis vs. Diarrhea**: Encopresis is the leakage of stool around a <b style="color:red">fecal impaction</b> in a constipated child; diarrhea is an increase in stool frequency and liquidity without impaction.
* **PPIs vs. H2RAs in GERD**: PPIs (e.g., Omeprazole) are used for <b style="color:red">long-term management</b>; H2RAs (e.g., Ranitidine) are not recommended for chronic GERD treatment.
* **Projectile vs. Non-projectile Vomiting**: Projectile vomiting suggests <b style="color:red">Increased ICP or Pyloric Stenosis</b>; non-projectile vomiting is more common in GERD or Gastroenteritis.
* **Bilious vs. Bloody Vomitus**: Bilious vomiting (green) indicates obstruction <b style="color:red">distal to the ampulla of Vater</b>; bloody vomiting (hematemesis) indicates gastritis, ulcers, or esophagitis.
* **Achalasia vs. Pyloric Stenosis Imaging**: Achalasia shows a <b style="color:red">"bird's beak"</b> on barium swallow; Pyloric stenosis is typically diagnosed via <b style="color:red">ultrasound</b> (thickened pylorus).
* **Reactive Arthritis vs. Sepsis**: Reactive arthritis is a <b style="color:red">post-infectious</b> (1-3 weeks later) joint pain; sepsis is an acute, systemic inflammatory response during the active infection.
* **Lactulose vs. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)**: Both are osmotic laxatives used for <b style="color:red">maintenance</b> in constipation; PEG is often used for both rapid disimpaction and maintenance.
* **Sandifer Syndrome vs. Seizures**: Sandifer syndrome involves arching and neck posturing <b style="color:red">temporally related to feeding</b> (reflux-induced); seizures are generally not related to meals.

| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classification by Mechanism**   | <b style="color:red">Functional</b> (myopathic, neuropathic) or <b style="color:red">Mechanical</b> (physical intraluminal or extraintestinal).             |
| **Classification by Extent**      | <b style="color:red">Partial</b> (allows passage of liquid/gas) or <b style="color:red">Complete</b> (nothing passes).                                      |
| **Anatomic Localization**         | <b style="color:red">Upper GI</b> (bilious vomiting, minimal distention) vs <b style="color:red">Lower GI</b> (abdominal distention, feculent vomiting).    |

### Functional Obstruction: Ileus
*   <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> is defined as the failure of intestinal peristalsis (paralytic/adynamic) without evidence of mechanical obstruction.
*   Common triggers for <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> include abdominal surgery (usually resolves within 72 hours), infections (AGE, pneumonia, peritonitis), and metabolic abnormalities like <b style="color:red">hypokalemia</b>, hypercalcemia, and acidosis.
*   Medications that cause <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> include opiates, vincristine, and antimotility agents like <b style="color:red">loperamide</b>.
*   The clinical presentation of <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> involves abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, a tympanitic abdomen, and <b style="color:red">minimal or absent bowel sounds</b>.
*   Radiographic diagnosis of <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> shows air-fluid levels without progressive bowel distention; barium enema reveals delayed movement through the lumen.
*   Management of <b style="color:red">Ileus</b> focuses on correcting underlying abnormalities, nasogastric decompression, fluid replacement, and mitigating iatrogenic causes (e.g., stopping offending drugs).

### Mechanical Obstruction: Intussusception
*   <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is the invagination of one segment of intestine (intussusceptum) into an adjacent segment (intussuscipiens).
*   <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children between <b style="color:red">5 months and 3 years of age</b>.
*   <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is the most common abdominal emergency in children under 2 years old, with a 3:1 male-to-female ratio.
*   The most common anatomic type of <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is <b style="color:red">ileocolic</b>, followed by cecocolic and ileoileal.
*   While 90% of cases are <b style="color:red">idiopathic</b> (often linked to hypertrophied Peyer's patches), lead points like <b style="color:red">Meckel diverticulum</b>, polyps, or lymphoma are common in children over 2 years old.
*   The typical presentation of <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is a previously well child with sudden, <b style="color:red">paroxysmal colicky pain</b> who is comfortable between episodes.
*   The classic triad of <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> (occurring in <30% of cases) includes abdominal pain, a sausage-shaped mass, and <b style="color:red">"currant jelly" stools</b> (blood + mucus).
*   Physical examination of <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> may reveal a slightly tender, <b style="color:red">sausage-shaped mass</b> in the right upper abdomen.
*   On Ultrasound, <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is diagnosed by the <b style="color:red">"Target sign"</b> or <b style="color:red">"Pseudo-kidney sign"</b>; Barium enema shows the <b style="color:red">"Coiled spring sign."</b>
*   Conservative treatment for <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> involves radiologic <b style="color:red">hydrostatic reduction</b> (fluoroscopic or ultrasound-guided).
*   Surgical intervention for <b style="color:red">Intussusception</b> is indicated for shock, suspected bowel necrosis/perf, peritonitis, or multiple recurrences.

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

| Feature | <b style="color:red">Crohn's Disease (CD)</b> | <b style="color:red">Ulcerative Colitis (UC)</b> |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distribution** | Any part of GI tract (mouth to anus); <b style="color:red">Skip lesions</b>. | Confined to colon and rectum; <b style="color:red">Continuous involvement</b>. |
| **Inflammation Depth** | <b style="color:red">Transmural</b> (all layers). | <b style="color:red">Mucosal</b> (surface layer). |
| **GI Symptoms** | Chronic pain, RLQ mass, <b style="color:red">perianal lesions</b> (fistula/abscess). | <b style="color:red">Rectal bleeding</b>, diarrhea with mucus. |
| **Growth Failure** | <b style="color:red">Common</b> in pediatric cases. | Not common. |
| **Histology** | <b style="color:red">Noncaseating granulomas</b>; crypt distortion. | Crypt distortion and abscesses; no granulomas. |
| **Extraintestinal** | Arthritis, uveitis, skin lesions. | <b style="color:red">Pyoderma gangrenosum</b>, Sclerosing cholangitis. |

*   <b style="color:red">IBD pathogenesis</b> involves genetic predisposition (e.g., <b style="color:red">NOD2 gene</b> in CD), dysbiosis (microbiota imbalance), and environmental triggers like the Western diet.
*   Diagnosis of <b style="color:red">IBD</b> utilizes <b style="color:red">Fecal calprotectin</b> as a marker of inflammation and colonoscopy with biopsy for confirmation.
*   Pharmacological treatment of <b style="color:red">IBD</b> includes <b style="color:red">Aminosalicylates</b> (first-line for mild UC), Corticosteroids (remission induction), and <b style="color:red">Biologics</b> (Anti-TNF like Infliximab).
*   <b style="color:red">Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)</b> is a primary therapy for pediatric Crohn's Disease.
*   Long-term monitoring for <b style="color:red">IBD</b> involves growth tracking, bone density (osteopenia risk), and <b style="color:red">cancer screening</b> for chronic UC.

### Disorders of Malabsorption

*   <b style="color:red">Celiac Disease</b> is an immune-mediated disorder elicited by <b style="color:red">gluten</b> (found in wheat, rye, and barley) in genetically predisposed individuals (HLA-DQ2.5/DQ8).
*   <b style="color:red">Repeated rotavirus infections</b> are associated with an increased risk of developing Celiac Disease.
*   <b style="color:red">Iron deficiency anemia</b> is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of Celiac Disease.
*   Diagnostic serology for <b style="color:red">Celiac Disease</b> includes <b style="color:red">anti-TG2 IgA</b> (first line) and anti-endomysial antibodies.
*   Small bowel biopsy in <b style="color:red">Celiac Disease</b> reveals <b style="color:red">villous atrophy</b>, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes.
*   Treatment for <b style="color:red">Celiac Disease</b> requires a lifelong, strict <b style="color:red">gluten-free diet</b> and correction of micronutrient deficiencies (Iron, Zinc, Vit D).
*   <b style="color:red">Postinfectious Diarrhea</b> in toddlers is often caused by <b style="color:red">secondary lactase deficiency</b> or food protein allergy following an acute GI infection.
*   <b style="color:red">Bacterial Overgrowth</b> (SIBO) involves colonization of the small intestine, leading to <b style="color:red">steatorrhea</b> (from bile salt deconjugation) and Vitamin B12 deficiency; treated with Metronidazole.
*   <b style="color:red">Short Bowel Syndrome</b> results from malabsorption secondary to the loss of <b style="color:red">>50% of the small bowel</b>.
*   <b style="color:red">Lactase Deficiency</b> types include primary (physiologic decline common in 40% of Asians) and <b style="color:red">secondary lactose intolerance</b> (transient damage post-infection/malnutrition).
*   Diagnosis of <b style="color:red">Lactase Deficiency</b> is usually made via a <b style="color:red">dietary elimination trial</b> or an H2 breath test.

### Critical Comparisons and High-Yield Distinctions

2.  <b style="color:red">Upper vs Lower GI Obstruction</b>: Upper GI presents with <b style="color:red">bilious vomiting</b> and low distention; Lower GI presents with <b style="color:red">feculent vomiting</b> and significant distention.
3.  <b style="color:red">Crohn's vs Ulcerative Colitis Distribution</b>: Crohn's is <b style="color:red">anywhere</b> (skip lesions); UC is <b style="color:red">rectum/colon only</b> (continuous).
4.  <b style="color:red">Crohn's vs Ulcerative Colitis Depth</b>: Crohn's is <b style="color:red">transmural</b> (all layers); UC is <b style="color:red">mucosal</b> only.
5.  <b style="color:red">Growth Failure</b>: Highly common in pediatric <b style="color:red">Crohn's</b>; rare in Ulcerative Colitis.
6.  <b style="color:red">Bleeding Profile</b>: <b style="color:red">Gross rectal bleeding</b> is the hallmark of UC; bleeding in Crohn's is less consistent but perianal disease (fistulas) is prominent.
7.  <b style="color:red">Intussusception Triad</b>: Sausage mass, paroxysmal pain, and <b style="color:red">currant jelly stools</b>.
8.  <b style="color:red">Imaging Signs</b>: <b style="color:red">Target sign</b> (Intussusception U/S or CT obstruction); <b style="color:red">Coiled spring</b> (Intussusception Barium); <b style="color:red">Bird's beak</b> (CT obstruction).
9.  <b style="color:red">Meconium Passage</b>: Failure to pass meconium within <b style="color:red">24-48 hours</b> is an alarm sign for Hirschsprung or neonatal obstruction.
10. <b style="color:red">Celiac Pathology</b>: Characterized by <b style="color:red">villous atrophy</b>; whereas Lactase deficiency is an enzymatic/transport defect without necessarily having atrophy (except in secondary cases).
11. <b style="color:red">Nutrient Deficiencies</b>: <b style="color:red">Iron deficiency</b> is the top sign in Celiac; <b style="color:red">Vitamin B12 deficiency</b> is a hallmark of Bacterial Overgrowth.
12. <b style="color:red">Age of Onset</b>: Intussusception peaks at <b style="color:red">5 months to 3 years</b>; IBD peaks in late adolescence.
13. <b style="color:red">Strangulating vs Simple Obstruction</b>: Strangulating presents with <b style="color:red">fever, acidosis, and leukocytosis</b>; simple obstruction presents mainly with mechanical symptoms.
14. <b style="color:red">Celiac Serology</b>: Anti-TG2 IgA is the first-line test; total IgA must be checked to ensure no IgA deficiency is masking results.
15. <b style="color:red">Lactose Intolerance Diagnosis</b>: A clinical <b style="color:red">dietary elimination trial</b> is often preferred over the more complex H2 breath test.

## Summary
text
### General Principles of Pediatric Gastrointestinal Obstruction

* Classification by Mechanism: Intestinal obstruction is classified as Functional (myopathic or neuropathic failure of peristalsis) or Mechanical (physical intraluminal or extraintestinal blockage).
* Classification by Extent: Intestinal obstruction is categorized as Partial (allows liquid/gas passage) or Complete (nothing passes).
* Localization by Vomiting Type: Upper GI obstructions typically present with bilious vomiting, while lower GI obstructions present with feculent vomiting.
* Localization by Distention: Upper GI obstructions usually show minimal distention; lower GI obstructions show significant abdominal distention.
* Classification by Blood Flow: Obstructions are either Simple (no ischemia) or Strangulating (compromised blood flow, often with absent bowel sounds and a painful mass).
* Neonatal Presentation: Warning signs of obstruction include maternal polyhydramnios, failure to pass meconium within 24-48 hours, and "currant jelly" stools.
* Radiographic Signs: Plain X-rays of intestinal obstruction show distended loops, air-fluid levels, and a paucity of colonic air.
* CT Scan Findings: The "Target sign" indicates bowel wall thickening, "Pneumatosis intestinalis" refers to air in the bowel wall, and the "beak sign" indicates distal narrowing.
* Management Priorities: Treatment for intestinal obstruction includes bowel decompression (NGT/OGT), fluid resuscitation, monitoring electrolytes, and either a conservative trial (for partial) or early surgery (for complete or malrotation).

### Esophageal Atresia (EA) and Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TEF)

| Category | Features of Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula (EA/TEF) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pathogenesis** | Failure of the esophagus to develop as a continuous passage; over 90% are associated with a Tracheoesophageal Fistula (TEF). Frequently associated with VACTERL syndrome (Vertebral, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheal, Esophageal, Renal, Limb). |
| **Classification** | Type C is the <b style="color:red">most common</b> (86%): upper esophagus is atretic, distal portion connects to the trachea. Type E (H-type) is a fistula without atresia, presenting as chronic respiratory problems. |
| **Clinical Presentation** | Neonates exhibit <b style="color:red">frothing and bubbling</b> at the mouth/nose, episodes of coughing, cyanosis, and respiratory distress. H-type presents later with recurrent pneumonia or respiratory symptoms. |
| **Diagnosis** | Primary bedside test: <b style="color:red">failure to pass an NGT or OGT</b> into the stomach. Prenatal U/S shows polyhydramnios and absence of a stomach bubble. |
| **Imaging** | X-ray shows a <b style="color:red">coiled feeding tube</b> in the esophageal pouch. An airless scaphoid abdomen suggests pure EA; an air-distended stomach indicates a coexisting TEF. |
| **Management** | Priorities include airway maintenance, pouch decompression, and avoiding mechanical ventilation, as positive pressure can cause gastric distension/perforation via fistula. |
| **Treatment** | Definitively treated with Primary Complete Repair (ligation and anastomosis) or Staged Repair (gastrostomy first) for high-risk infants. |

### Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS)

| Category | Features of Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Epidemiology** | More common in white males; strongly associated with maternal history and <b style="color:red">erythromycin/macrolide</b> use in the first 2 weeks of life. |
| **Pathogenesis** | Hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle leading to gastric outlet obstruction. |
| **Clinical Presentation** | <b style="color:red">Non-bilious, projectile vomiting</b> that is postprandial, typically starting after 3 weeks of age. |
| **Physical Exam** | Hallmark finding is a firm, movable, <b style="color:red">olive-shaped mass</b> (2cm) in the epigastrium, often palpated after vomiting, plus visible gastric peristaltic waves. |
| **Metabolic Profile** | Significant vomiting leads to <b style="color:red">hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis</b> and potentially "Icteropyloric Syndrome" (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia). |
| **Diagnosis** | Ultrasound (95% sensitivity) shows pyloric thickness 3-4mm and length 15-19mm. |
| **Contrast Imaging** | Contrast studies reveal the <b style="color:red">string sign</b> (narrow channel), <b style="color:red">shoulder sign</b> (muscle bulge), and <b style="color:red">double tract sign</b>. |
| **Treatment** | Initial management is fluid/electrolyte correction. The surgical procedure of choice is <b style="color:red">Pyloromyotomy</b>. |

### Intestinal Atresia and Stenosis

| Category                        | Features of Duodenal Atresia                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pathogenesis**                | Caused by <b style="color:red">failed recanalization</b> of the intestinal lumen during the 6th-7th week of gestation.                                                                     |
| **Associations**                | 1/3 of patients have <b style="color:red">Trisomy 21</b>; 50% are premature.                                                                                                               |
| **Clinical Presentation**       | The <b style="color:red">hallmark is bilious vomiting WITHOUT abdominal distention</b>, often with a history of maternal polyhydramnios.                                                   |
| **Diagnosis**                   | Plain abdominal X-ray shows the classic <b style="color:red">"double bubble" sign</b> (air in the stomach and proximal duodenum).                                                          |
| **Treatment**                   | Surgical intervention is required, typically a <b style="color:red">Duodenoduodenostomy</b>.                                                                                               |
| **Note on Jejunoileal Atresia** | Unlike duodenal atresia, jejunoileal atresia is usually caused by <b style="color:red">intrauterine vascular accidents</b> and is not typically associated with extraintestinal anomalies. |

### Hirschsprung’s Disease (HD)

| Category | Features of Hirschsprung’s Disease (HD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pathogenesis** | Failure of neuroblasts to migrate, resulting in an <b style="color:red">absence of ganglion cells</b> (Meissner/Auerbach plexuses). This causes a lack of bowel relaxation and functional obstruction. |
| **Epidemiology** | The <b style="color:red">most common cause of lower GI obstruction</b> in neonates; Male:Female ratio is 4:1. Strongly associated with the RET gene and Trisomy 21. |
| **Clinical Presentation** | Suspected in full-term infants with <b style="color:red">delayed passage of meconium</b> (>24-48h). Signs include distention, bilious emesis, and explosive stool passage on DRE. |
| **Diagnosis (Gold Standard)** | <b style="color:red">Rectal Suction Biopsy</b> showing absence of ganglion cells and hypertrophied nerve bundles. |
| **Imaging (Barium Enema)** | Shows a transition zone; a <b style="color:red">Rectal:Sigmoid diameter ratio of ≤1</b> is highly suggestive of HD. |
| **Complications** | The most serious complication is <b style="color:red">Enterocolitis</b> (Hirschsprung’s-associated enterocolitis), presenting with sepsis, fever, and explosive diarrhea. |
| **Treatment** | Definitive treatment is a <b style="color:red">Primary pull-through procedure</b> (e.g., Soave). Staged surgery with an ostomy is used if enterocolitis is present. |

### Functional Obstruction: Ileus

* Functional Obstruction (Ileus) refers to the failure of intestinal peristalsis without a physical blockage, often triggered by abdominal surgery (resolves in 72h), infections (AGE, pneumonia, peritonitis), or metabolic issues.
* Metabolic causes of Ileus include <b style="color:red">hypokalemia</b>, hypercalcemia, and acidosis.
* Medications inducing Ileus include opiates, vincristine, and antimotility agents like <b style="color:red">loperamide</b>.
* Clinical signs of Ileus include abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and <b style="color:red">minimal/absent bowel sounds</b> (tympanitic abdomen).
* Diagnosis of Ileus via X-ray shows air-fluid levels without the distinct distended loops seen in mechanical obstruction.
* Management of Ileus focuses on correcting underlying abnormalities, stopping offending drugs, and nasogastric decompression.

### Mechanical Obstruction: Intussusception

* Intussusception is the invagination (telescoping) of one bowel segment (intussusceptum) into another (intussuscipiens), most commonly the <b style="color:red">ileocolic</b> type.
* Epidemiology: The peak age for intussusception is <b style="color:red">5 months to 3 years</b>; it is the most common abdominal emergency in children under 2.
* Lead Points: 90% are idiopathic (linked to hypertrophied Peyer's patches), but in children >2 years, lead points like <b style="color:red">Meckel diverticulum</b>, polyps, or lymphoma are common.
* Clinical Triad: The classic triad of intussusception is paroxysmal colicky pain, <b style="color:red">"currant jelly" stools</b> (blood + mucus), and a <b style="color:red">sausage-shaped mass</b> in the RUQ.
* Ultrasound Signs: Diagnosis is supported by the <b style="color:red">"Target sign"</b> or <b style="color:red">"Pseudo-kidney sign"</b> on ultrasound.
* Radiographic Signs: Barium enema shows the <b style="color:red">"coiled spring sign"</b>.
* Conservative Management: The primary treatment for intussusception is <b style="color:red">radiologic hydrostatic reduction</b> (fluoroscopic or U/S guided).
* Surgical Indications: Surgery for intussusception is indicated if there is shock, peritonitis, bowel necrosis, or multiple recurrences.

### Meckel Diverticulum

| Category | Features of Meckel Diverticulum |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pathogenesis** | The <b style="color:red">most common congenital GI anomaly</b>; caused by incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct. |
| **Rule of 2s** | 2% of population, symptomatic before age 2, 2 inches long, 2 feet from ileocecal valve, 2 types of ectopic tissue (gastric/pancreatic). |
| **Clinical Presentation** | Manifests as <b style="color:red">painless rectal bleeding</b>; stools are classically described as <b style="color:red">brick-colored or maroon</b>. |
| **Diagnosis** | Confirmed by a <b style="color:red">Meckel radionuclide scan</b> (Technetium-99m) which detects ectopic gastric mucosa. |
| **Treatment** | Surgical excision via <b style="color:red">Diverticulectomy</b> is the standard management. |

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

* IBD Distribution: Crohn's Disease can affect the entire tract (mouth to anus) with <b style="color:red">skip lesions</b>; Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is continuous and limited to the colon/rectum.
* Inflammation Depth: Crohn's is <b style="color:red">transmural</b> (entire wall); UC is limited to the <b style="color:red">mucosa</b>.
* Hallmark Symptoms: <b style="color:red">Rectal bleeding</b> is the hallmark of UC; Crohn's presents with abdominal pain, RLQ mass, and perianal lesions.
* Growth Failure: Significantly more common in <b style="color:red">Crohn's Disease</b> than UC.
* Histology: <b style="color:red">Noncaseating granulomas</b> are pathognomonic for Crohn's; UC shows crypt abscesses and distortion.
* Extraintestinal Manifestations: UC is specifically linked to <b style="color:red">pyoderma gangrenosum</b> and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
* Diagnosis: <b style="color:red">Fecal calprotectin</b> is used as a stool marker for inflammation; colonoscopy with biopsy is required for confirmation.
* Treatment: Mild UC is treated with <b style="color:red">aminosalicylates</b>; IBD remission is induced with corticosteroids; biologics like Infliximab are used for severe cases.
* Dietary Therapy: <b style="color:red">Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN)</b> is a primary dietary therapy for pediatric Crohn’s Disease.

### Celiac Disease and Malabsorption

* Celiac Disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by <b style="color:red">gluten</b> (wheat, rye, barley) in genetically susceptible individuals (HLA-DQ2.5/DQ8).
* Extraintestinal Celiac Sign: The most common extraintestinal manifestation of Celiac is <b style="color:red">iron deficiency anemia</b>.
* Celiac Serology: First-line test is <b style="color:red">anti-TG2 IgA</b>; total IgA must be checked to ensure deficiency doesn't mask a negative result.
* Celiac Histology: Small bowel biopsy shows <b style="color:red">villous atrophy</b>, crypt hyperplasia, and increased lymphocytes.
* Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO): Small intestine colonization that causes <b style="color:red">steatorrhea</b> (via bile salt deconjugation) and <b style="color:red">Vitamin B12 deficiency</b>; treated with Metronidazole.
* Lactase Deficiency: Primary (physiologic decline) vs. Secondary (transient post-infection damage); diagnosed primarily via <b style="color:red">dietary elimination trial</b> or H2 breath test.
* Short Bowel Syndrome: Defined as the loss of <b style="color:red">>50% of the small bowel</b>.

### High-Yield Comparisons for Exams

* Vomiting Color: Pyloric Stenosis is <b style="color:red">non-bilious</b>; Duodenal Atresia and Hirschsprung's are <b style="color:red">bilious</b>.
* Abdominal Distention: Pyloric Stenosis and Duodenal Atresia have <b style="color:red">no/minimal distention</b>; Hirschsprung's and Lower GI Obstruction have <b style="color:red">prominent distention</b>.
* Stool Characteristics: Intussusception has <b style="color:red">currant jelly stools</b>; Meckel Diverticulum has <b style="color:red">maroon/brick stools</b>; UC has gross <b style="color:red">bloody mucus stools</b>.
* Key X-ray Signs: Duodenal Atresia shows the <b style="color:red">Double Bubble</b>; Intussusception shows the <b style="color:red">Coiled Spring</b> (on barium); Pyloric Stenosis shows the <b style="color:red">String Sign</b>.
* Key Physical Exam Signs: Pyloric Stenosis has an <b style="color:red">Olive mass</b>; Intussusception has a <b style="color:red">Sausage mass</b>.
* Bowel Sounds: Mechanical obstruction has <b style="color:red">hyperactive</b> sounds initially; Ileus and Strangulating obstruction have <b style="color:red">absent/minimal</b> sounds.
* Celiac vs. Lactose Intolerance: Celiac involves <b style="color:red">villous atrophy</b> and iron deficiency; Lactose intolerance is an enzymatic defect with no mucosal damage on biopsy.
* Crohn's vs. UC Depth: Crohn's is <b style="color:red">transmural</b> (risk of fistulas); UC is <b style="color:red">mucosal</b> only.
* Meconium Passage: Delayed meconium passage in a full-term infant is an alarm for <b style="color:red">Hirschsprung's Disease</b>.
* Growth Failure: Prominent in <b style="color:red">Crohn's Disease</b> and <b style="color:red">Celiac Disease</b>; rare in Ulcerative Colitis.

### Neonatal Cholestasis: General Principles

| Aspect | Neonatal Cholestasis Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| <b style="color:red">Definition</b> | Reduction in bile formation or excretion resulting in jaundice during the first 28 days of life. |
| <b style="color:red">Biochemical Criteria</b> | Direct Bilirubin <b style="color:red">>1.0 mg/dL</b> if Total Bilirubin (TB) is <b style="color:red">≤5 mg/dL</b>; OR Direct Bilirubin <b style="color:red">≥20%</b> of TB if TB is <b style="color:red">>5 mg/dL</b>. |
| <b style="color:red">Typical Features</b> | Icterus (scleral discoloration), highly staining urine (dark yellow), acholic stools (pale, white, or light yellow), and hepatomegaly. |
| <b style="color:red">Common Intrahepatic Causes</b> | Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, TORCH infections, metabolic diseases (galactosemia, tyrosinemia), and prolonged TPN (>2 weeks). |
| <b style="color:red">Common Extrahepatic Causes</b> | Biliary Atresia and Choledochal cyst. |
| <b style="color:red">Malabsorption Complications</b> | Failure of bile delivery leads to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, causing malnutrition, growth retardation, and steatorrhea. |
| <b style="color:red">Portal Hypertension Features</b> | Manifests as hypersplenism, ascites (due to hypoalbuminemia), and varices which may cause hematemesis or hematochezia. |

* In <b style="color:red">Neonatal Cholestasis</b>, the first and most important laboratory test is bilirubin fractionation to determine if the elevation is direct (conjugated) or indirect.
* <b style="color:red">Icteropyloric Syndrome</b> in the source text context usually refers to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but in <b style="color:red">Neonatal Cholestasis</b>, the focus is always on the conjugated fraction.
* <b style="color:red">Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis (PNAC)</b> occurs in 1/5 of neonates receiving PN for <b style="color:red">>2 weeks</b>; risk factors include prematurity and sepsis.
* <b style="color:red">Ursodeoxycholic acid</b> is used in <b style="color:red">Neonatal Cholestasis</b> to increase bile secretion, but it is ineffective if there is a physical obstruction (e.g., Biliary Atresia).
* <b style="color:red">Galactosemia and Tyrosinemia</b>, which cause cholestasis, are detectable via the <b style="color:red">Philippine Expanded Newborn Screening</b> program.

### Major Extrahepatic Causes of Cholestasis

| Feature | Biliary Atresia | Choledochal Cyst |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b style="color:red">Pathogenesis</b> | Progressive fibroinflammatory obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tree. | Congenital dilation of the biliary tree without initial obstruction. |
| <b style="color:red">Epidemiology</b> | <b style="color:red">Most common and severe</b> cause of NC; common in East Asia. | 2-3% of NC cases; significant female predominance. |
| <b style="color:red">Clinical Presentation</b> | Normal at birth, then jaundice persists <b style="color:red">>2 weeks</b>. | Classic Triad (Older children): <b style="color:red">Abdominal pain, jaundice, and palpable mass</b>. |
| <b style="color:red">Associated Anomalies</b> | Polysplenia, situs inversus, or cardiac anomalies. | Complicated by cholangitis, pancreatitis, and malignant transformation. |
| <b style="color:red">Diagnostic Sign</b> | Liver biopsy: <b style="color:red">Bile duct proliferation</b> and perilobular fibrosis with intact architecture. | Ultrasound or MRCP showing cyst; <b style="color:red">Type I</b> is the most common (70-90%). |
| <b style="color:red">Management</b> | <b style="color:red">Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy</b> (best before 8 weeks); eventually requires liver transplant. | <b style="color:red">Primary excision of the cyst</b> with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. |

* <b style="color:red">Inspissated Bile Syndrome</b> is a rare cause of cholestasis where bile plugs or sludge obstruct the ducts, often linked to hemolysis or drugs like <b style="color:red">Ceftriaxone</b>.
* In <b style="color:red">Biliary Atresia</b>, the <b style="color:red">Kasai Procedure</b> has a 90% success rate if performed before the 8th week of life.
* <b style="color:red">Choledochal Cyst</b> in infants presents with cholestatic jaundice and severe liver dysfunction (ascites, coagulopathy).

### Idiopathic Neonatal Hepatitis (INH)

* <b style="color:red">Idiopathic Neonatal Hepatitis (INH)</b>, also known as <b style="color:red">Giant Cell Hepatitis</b>, is a diagnosis of exclusion accounting for 13-30% of NC cases.
* The histologic hallmark of <b style="color:red">Idiopathic Neonatal Hepatitis</b> is <b style="color:red">Giant cell transformation</b> and lobular disarray.
* <b style="color:red">Idiopathic Neonatal Hepatitis</b> can be sporadic or familial; the familial form often suggests an underlying genetic or metabolic aberration.

### Viral Hepatitis Basics

| Virus | Type | Route | Incubation | Chronic Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b style="color:red">Hepatitis A (HAV)</b> | RNA (Picornavirus) | Fecal-oral | <b style="color:red">15-49 days (Shortest)</b> | No |
| <b style="color:red">Hepatitis B (HBV)</b> | dsDNA (Hepadnaviridae) | Perinatal, Blood | Average 3 months | Yes (High in neonates) |
| <b style="color:red">Hepatitis C (HCV)</b> | RNA | Perinatal, Blood | Variable | Yes |

* <b style="color:red">Viral Hepatitis</b> pathogenesis is usually immune-mediated (especially HBV), with necrosis most marked in <b style="color:red">centrilobular</b> areas.
* <b style="color:red">Hepatitis C (HCV)</b> is unique among hepatotropic viruses because <b style="color:red">fatty exchange (steatosis)</b> is a common histologic finding.
* In <b style="color:red">Acute Viral Hepatitis</b>, the liver morphology typically returns to normal within <b style="color:red">3 months</b> of infection.
* <b style="color:red">Hepatitis A</b> period of communicability is <b style="color:red">2 weeks before to 7 days after</b> the onset of jaundice.
* <b style="color:red">Hepatitis A</b> diagnosis is confirmed by <b style="color:red">Anti-HAV IgM</b>, which is detectable when symptoms appear and remains for 4-6 months.
* <b style="color:red">Hepatitis A Vaccination</b> is given as a 2-dose series starting at <b style="color:red">12 months</b> of age, with at least a 6-month interval.

### Hepatitis B (HBV) Management

* The most important risk factor for acquiring <b style="color:red">Hepatitis B</b> in children is <b style="color:red">perinatal exposure</b>; infants of HBeAg-positive mothers have a 90% risk of chronic infection if untreated.
* The <b style="color:red">first biochemical evidence</b> of HBV infection is an elevation of <b style="color:red">ALT</b> levels, occurring 6-7 weeks after exposure.
* <b style="color:red">HBsAg</b> (Surface Antigen) presence indicates <b style="color:red">active infection</b> (acute or chronic).
* <b style="color:red">Anti-HBs</b> (Surface Antibody) indicate <b style="color:red">immunity</b> via either resolved infection or vaccination.
* <b style="color:red">IgM anti-HBc</b> (Core Antibody) is the hallmark marker for <b style="color:red">recent or acute HBV infection</b>.
* <b style="color:red">HBeAg</b> (e-Antigen) correlates with <b style="color:red">active viral replication and high infectivity</b>.
* For newborns weight <b style="color:red">≥2kg</b> born to HBsAg(+) mothers, administer both <b style="color:red">HBV vaccine and HBIG</b> within 12 hours of life.
* If a newborn is <b style="color:red">&lt2kg</b>, the birth dose of HBV vaccine does <b style="color:red">NOT</b> count toward the 3-dose series; 3 additional doses are required.

### Liver Abscess

* <b style="color:red">Staphylococcus aureus</b> is the leading single pathogenic agent for <b style="color:red">Liver Abscess</b> in children without underlying intestinal disease.
* The most common routes for <b style="color:red">Liver Abscess</b> include the <b style="color:red">portal vein</b> (from omphalitis or appendicitis) and the <b style="color:red">hepatic artery</b> (from sepsis).
* <b style="color:red">Liver Abscess</b> imaging: Ultrasound/CT is preferred; 75% are located in the <b style="color:red">right lobe</b> and 70% are solitary.
* <b style="color:red">Liver Abscess</b> treatment involves 2-3 weeks of <b style="color:red">IV antibiotics</b> followed by oral therapy to complete a 4-6 week course.
* <b style="color:red">Amoebic Liver Abscess</b> requires treatment with <b style="color:red">Metronidazole plus Paromomycin</b>.

### Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

* <b style="color:red">Pigment stones</b> account for 70% of pediatric gallstones, while cholesterol stones comprise 15-20%.
* <b style="color:red">Biliary Pseudolithiasis</b> is a unique condition caused by <b style="color:red">high-dose Ceftriaxone</b> use (>10 days) resulting in calcium-ceftriaxone salt precipitates.
* <b style="color:red">Biliary Pseudolithiasis</b> typically <b style="color:red">resolves spontaneously</b> within weeks to months after discontinuing Ceftriaxone.
* The hallmark clinical feature of <b style="color:red">Cholelithiasis</b> is <b style="color:red">recurrent abdominal colicky pain</b> in the Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ).
* <b style="color:red">Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</b> is the treatment of choice for symptomatic children with gallstones.

# Cardio 10 - Heart Failure 

## Summary

### Definitions and Clinical Overview of Pediatric Heart Failure

* <b style="color:red">Pediatric Heart Failure</b> is a clinical and pathophysiologic syndrome resulting from ventricular dysfunction, volume overload, or pressure overload, occurring alone or in combination.
* A <b style="color:red">Structural or Functional Impairment</b> of ventricular filling or blood ejection characterizes the complex syndrome of heart failure.
* The <b style="color:red">Primary Work of an Infant</b> is feeding; therefore, heart failure in infants often manifests as interrupted feeding sessions or "suck-rest-suck" cycles.
* <b style="color:red">Poor Growth (Failure to Thrive)</b> is a key symptom of heart failure often discovered late in children aged 3 to 5 years.
* <b style="color:red">Exercise Intolerance and Fatigue</b> are the clinical benchmarks for heart failure in older children, whereas feeding tolerance is the benchmark for infants.
* <b style="color:red">Respiratory Distress</b> in pediatric heart failure manifests as tachypnea, subcostal retractions, or intercostal retractions, often leading to recurrent respiratory tract infections.
* <b style="color:red">Cardiac Output (CO)</b> is calculated by the formula: <i style="color:blue">Stroke Volume (SV) × Heart Rate (HR)</i>.
* <i style="color:blue">Systolic Dysfunction</i> refers specifically to disorders in ventricular <b style="color:red">ejection</b> (contraction).
* <i style="color:blue">Diastolic Dysfunction</i> refers specifically to disorders in ventricular <b style="color:red">filling</b> (relaxation).

### Classification Systems for Heart Failure

| Classification System | Categories | Clinical Features/Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b style="color:red">Ross Classification</b> (Pediatric) | Class I to IV | I: No symptoms; II: Symptoms with vigorous activity; III: Symptoms with routine activity; IV: Symptoms at rest. |
| <b style="color:red">ACCF/AHA Stage A</b> | High Risk | Patients at high risk for HF (e.g., asymptomatic Dengue with bradycardia) but without structural disease. |
| <b style="color:red">ACCF/AHA Stage B</b> | Pre-Heart Failure | Structural heart disease (e.g., stable VSD) present but no current or previous symptoms. |
| <b style="color:red">ACCF/AHA Stage C</b> | Symptomatic HF | Structural heart disease with current or previous symptoms (e.g., activity intolerance). |
| <b style="color:red">ACCF/AHA Stage D</b> | Advanced HF | Refractory symptoms requiring intensive interventions like continuous IV inotropes. |

### Hemodynamics and Systemic Transport

* <b style="color:red">Preload (Ventricular Filling Volume)</b> is directly proportional to stroke volume; as venous return increases, the heart fills more and produces a greater stroke volume (within physiological limits).
* The <b style="color:red">Frank-Starling Principle</b> states that as the Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume (LVEDV) increases, the heart increases cardiac output until a maximum plateau is reached.
* <b style="color:red">Afterload (Peripheral Resistance)</b> is the resistance/tension against which the heart must pump; it is inversely proportional to stroke volume and cardiac output.
* <b style="color:red">Ventricular Compliance</b> refers to the elasticity of the heart; higher compliance allows the heart to accommodate more volume, thereby increasing potential stroke volume.
* <b style="color:red">Systemic Oxygen Transport</b> is determined by the product of cardiac output and oxygen content.
* In a <b style="color:red">Failing Heart</b>, increasing diastolic pressure or volume cannot produce a cardiac output similar to a normal heart, and excessive fluids may cause congestion.

### Adaptive Mechanisms in Heart Failure

* <b style="color:red">Myocardial Hypertrophy</b> is an adaptive response to maintain systolic emptying, but it can eventually lead to <i style="color:blue">diastolic dysfunction</i> due to the thickened wall.
* <b style="color:red">Adrenergic Stimulation (SNS)</b> increases heart rate and vascular tone via catecholamines (Epinephrine and Norepinephrine) as a compensatory mechanism.
* <b style="color:red">Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)</b> activation aims to maintain blood pressure but contributes to long-term cardiac stress.
* <b style="color:red">Atrial Natriuretic Peptides (ANP) and BNP</b> are released to promote urinary loss of sodium/water and act as vasodilators to counteract heart failure.
* An <b style="color:red">Increase in 2,3-DPG</b> occurs in heart failure to shift the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, facilitating oxygen delivery to tissues.

### Clinical Manifestations by Age and Side

* <b style="color:red">Infant-Specific Symptoms</b> of heart failure include "cold sweats" (due to SNS activation), poor feeding, ashen color, and poor weight gain.
* <b style="color:red">Left-Sided Failure (Pulmonary Congestion)</b> presents with tachypnea, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), nocturnal dyspnea, and wheezing.
* <b style="color:red">Right-Sided Failure (Systemic Congestion)</b> presents with hepatomegaly (liver congestion), puffy eyelids, distended neck veins, and bipedal/ankle edema.
* <b style="color:red">Abdominal Symptoms</b> such as nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain in heart failure children are typically due to liver congestion.

### Diagnostics for Pediatric Heart Failure

* <b style="color:red">Chest X-ray (CXR)</b> is used to detect cardiomegaly and assess pulmonary vascular patterns.
* <b style="color:red">Electrocardiogram (ECG)</b> is the best tool to detect rhythm disturbances that may be the primary cause of heart failure.
* <b style="color:red">Echocardiography (Echo)</b> is the standard clinical technique for assessing specific ventricular function and structure.
* <b style="color:red">B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)</b> is a cardiac neurohormone released during increased ventricular wall tension; it is specific for indicating heart failure.
* <b style="color:red">Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)</b> helps quantify RV/LV mass, volume, and coronary anatomy.

### General Management and Pharmacology

| Drug Class | Examples | Mechanism of Action / Clinical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <b style="color:red">Diuretics</b> | Furosemide, Spironolactone | Reduces circulating volume to treat pulmonary overload; requires electrolyte monitoring. |
| <b style="color:red">ACE Inhibitors</b> | Captopril, Enalapril | Reduces afterload by decreasing peripheral resistance; prevents <i style="color:blue">cardiac remodeling</i> (scarring). |
| <b style="color:red">Beta-Blockers</b> | Metoprolol, Carvedilol | Chronic treatment to improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality; Carvedilol has free radical scavenging. |
| <b style="color:red">ARNI</b> | Sacubitril + Valsartan | Combined inhibition of neprilysin (increasing BNP) and blocking Angiotensin II; acts synergistically against cell death. |
| <b style="color:red">Inotropes</b> | Digoxin, Dopamine | Exert positive inotropic effects (increase contractility); Digoxin used less now due to toxicity risk. |
| <b style="color:red">PDE Inhibitors</b> | Milrinone | Prevents cAMP degradation; provides positive inotropic effects and peripheral/pulmonary vasodilation. |
| <b style="color:red">New Therapies</b> | Seralaxin, Ivabradine | Seralaxin (human relaxin-2) for acute HF; Ivabradine lowers HR without decreasing contractility. |

* <b style="color:red">Dietary Management</b> includes increasing daily calories (due to hypermetabolic state) and "no added salt."
* <b style="color:red">Fluid Management</b> depends on etiology: Volume <i style="color:blue">restriction</i> is used for ventricular dysfunction, while volume <i style="color:blue">replacement</i> is used for blood loss/hypovolemia.
* <b style="color:red">Dopamine</b> at higher doses has alpha-adrenergic effects, but it provides <i style="color:blue">selective renal vasodilation</i> at specific doses.
* <b style="color:red">Nitroprusside</b> is an IV afterload reducer used in critically ill patients for short durations; it also benefits cardiac remodeling.

### High-Yield Comparisons and Differentiators

* <b style="color:red">Infant vs. Older Child</b>: Infants show heart failure through feeding interruptions and "cold sweats," while older children show it through exercise intolerance and orthopnea.
* <b style="color:red">Preload vs. Afterload</b>: Preload is the "filling" volume (directly proportional to CO); afterload is the "resistance" against ejection (inversely proportional to CO).
* <b style="color:red">Systolic vs. Diastolic Dysfunction</b>: Systolic is a problem with "pumping/ejection" (contraction); diastolic is a problem with "relaxing/filling."
* <b style="color:red">Left-sided vs. Right-sided Failure</b>: Left-sided causes <i style="color:blue">pulmonary</i> symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing); Right-sided causes <i style="color:blue">systemic</i> symptoms (hepatomegaly, edema).
* <b style="color:red">Ross vs. ACCF/AHA</b>: Ross classifies based on <i style="color:blue">functional/symptomatic class</i> (I-IV), while ACCF/AHA classifies based on <i style="color:blue">disease progression/risk</i> (Stages A-D).
* <b style="color:red">Stage B vs. Stage C HF</b>: Stage B has structural heart disease <i style="color:blue">without</i> symptoms; Stage C has structural heart disease <i style="color:blue">with</i> symptoms.
* <b style="color:red">ACE Inhibitors vs. Beta-Blockers</b>: ACE inhibitors are primarily used to reduce <i style="color:blue">afterload</i> and remodeling; Beta-blockers are used in <i style="color:blue">chronic</i> treatment to improve long-term survival and mortality.
* <b style="color:red">Dopamine vs. Dobutamine</b>: Dopamine has dose-dependent renal vasodilation and alpha effects; Dobutamine has direct inotropic effects and moderate peripheral resistance reduction.
* <b style="color:red">BNP vs. End-Diastolic Volume</b>: BNP is a <i style="color:blue">neurohormone</i> biomarker of wall stress; LVEDV is a <i style="color:blue">hemodynamic volume</i> measurement of preload.
* <b style="color:red">Milrinone vs. Digoxin</b>: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with vasodilatory properties; Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside with positive inotropic effects but higher toxicity risk.
* <b style="color:red">Hypovolemia vs. Ventricular Dysfunction</b>: In hypovolemic HF, the treatment is <i style="color:blue">fluid replacement</i>; in ventricular dysfunction HF, the treatment is <i style="color:blue">fluid restriction</i>.
* <b style="color:red">Sacubitril vs. Valsartan (in ARNI)</b>: Sacubitril blocks neprilysin to maintain high BNP; Valsartan blocks Angiotensin II to cause vasodilation.
* <b style="color:red">Inotropic vs. Lusitropic</b>: Inotropic relates to the force of <i style="color:blue">contraction</i>; lusitropic (implied by diastolic relaxation context) relates to the heart's ability to <i style="color:blue">relax</i>.

# Cardio 11 - Overview of Congenital Heart Disease
## Summary

### General Principles of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)

* Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) occurs in approximately <b>0.8% of live births</b>.
* In terms of timing of diagnosis for CHD, <b>40-50%</b> are diagnosed at 1 week old and <b>50-60%</b> are diagnosed at 1 month old.
* Congenital Heart Disease is the <b>leading cause of death</b> in children with congenital malformations.
* The <b>most commonly occurring congenital heart lesion</b> is the <b>Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)</b>, accounting for 30-35% of cases.
* <b>Acyanotic CHD</b> is divided into <b>Increased Volume Load</b> (ASD, VSD, AVSD, PDA) and <b>Increased Pressure Load</b> (Pulmonic stenosis, Aortic stenosis, Coarctation of the Aorta).
* <b>Cyanotic CHD</b> is divided into <b>Decreased Pulmonary Flow</b> (TOF, Pulmonary atresia, Tricuspid Atresia) and <b>Increased Pulmonary Flow</b> (TGA, TAPVR, Truncus arteriosus).
* To clinically check for cyanosis in a child, the <b>tongue or oral mucosa</b> should be inspected, as the lips can be affected by cold or anemia.
* <b>Clubbing</b> of fingernails in a pediatric patient indicates <b>chronic hypoxemia</b>.
* A <b>Left-to-Right (L → R) Shunt</b> occurs when pressure in the left side of the heart exceeds the right, leading to <b>volume overload</b> of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary circulation.
* Patients with <b>Acyanotic L → R shunts</b> are <b>initially not blue</b> but may present with frequent respiratory infections, tachypnea, and heart failure.
* A <b>Right-to-Left (R → L) Shunt</b> occurs when right-sided pressures exceed left-sided pressures (e.g., pulmonary hypertension), causing deoxygenated blood to enter systemic circulation and resulting in <b>cyanosis</b>.
* <b>Compliance</b> affects shunting; a more compliant pulmonary vasculature increases the likelihood of an L → R shunt.

### Acyanotic L-R Shunt Lesions (Increased Volume Load)

| Feature | Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) | Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) | Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD) | Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pathogenesis** | Left-to-right shunt at the atrial level; <b>Qp:Qs</b> ratios of 2:1 to 4:1. | Shunt from LV to RV during <b>systole</b>; RV does not enlarge because blood goes directly to PA. | Failure of endocardial cushions to meet; involves both atrial and ventricular septal defects. | Persistent connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery. |
| **Most Common Type** | <b>Ostium Secundum</b> (most common type overall). | Perimembranous (most common section). | <b>Complete AVSD</b> (common in Down Syndrome). | Juxtaductal connection. |
| **Clinical Findings** | Often asymptomatic; <b>S2 widely split and fixed</b>; SEM at LUSB. | Dyspnea, growth failure, <b>holosystolic murmur at LLSB</b>. | Heart failure in infancy, recurrent RTI, <b>holosystolic murmur at apex (MR)</b>. | Bounding peripheral pulses; <b>Machinery-like murmur</b> at 2nd left interspace. |
| **ECG Findings** | RAD, RAE, RVH, <b>rsR pattern</b> in V1. | LVH or BVH; LAE. | BVH or RVH; tall P waves; <b>Left Axis Deviation (LAD)</b>. | LVH, BVH. |
| **CXR Findings** | RAE, RVE, prominent <b>Main Pulmonary Artery (MPA)</b>. | LAE, LVH (large VSD), pulmonary edema. | <b>Biatrial and Biventricular enlargement</b>; congested lungs. | LAE, LVE, <b>Prominent aortic knob</b>; "Picket fence" on Echo. |
| **Treatment** | Transcatheter closure (if Qp:Qs > 2:1) or Surgery. | Small: observe (30-50% close). Large: surgery for failure to thrive or PAH. | Surgery must be performed <b>early during infancy</b>. | 1st line: Transcatheter; Medical: Indomethacin/Ibuprofen (if premature). |

* <b>Ostium Secundum ASD</b> is more common in <b>females</b> (M:F 1:3) and occurs in the region of the fossa ovalis.
* <b>Holt-Oram Syndrome</b> is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by <b>hypoplasia of radii</b>, 1st degree AV block, and <b>ASD</b>.
* <b>Sinus Venosus ASD</b> is commonly associated with <b>Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)</b>.
* <b>Ostium Primum ASD</b> (or Partial AVSD) presents with a <b>cleft in the anterior leaflet</b> of the mitral valve.
* <b>AVSD</b> is the <b>most common cardiac defect</b> in patients with <b>Down Syndrome</b>.
* In <b>AVSD</b>, the passage of blood from the LA through the mitral valve during systole produces a <b>murmur of Mitral Regurgitation</b> at the apex.
* <b>VSD</b> is the <b>most common cardiac malformation</b> overall, representing 25% of CHD.
* In <b>VSD</b>, the <b>Left Atrium (LA) and Left Ventricle (LV)</b> are the chambers that enlarge, rather than the RV.
* <b>Supracristal VSD</b> is a specific indication for surgery because it may lead to <b>Aortic Regurgitation (AR)</b>.
* <b>Eisenmenger physiology</b> is a complication of long-standing L-R shunts where pulmonary hypertension causes the shunt to reverse (Right-to-Left).
* <b>Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)</b> is significantly associated with <b>maternal rubella infection</b> in the first trimester.
* <b>PDA</b> is more common in <b>premature infants</b> because the smooth muscle in the ductus is less responsive to high PO2.
* A <b>systolic thrill</b> maximal in the 2nd left interspace is classic for <b>PDA</b>.
* <b>Aortopulmonary Window</b> is a condition where the pulmonary artery and aorta are attached, mimicking PDA symptoms but requiring <b>bypass surgery</b>.

### Acyanotic Obstructive Lesions (Increased Pressure Load)

| Feature | Pulmonary Valve Stenosis (PS) | Aortic Stenosis (AS) | Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Associated Syndromes** | <b>Noonan Syndrome</b> (PV dysplasia); Alagille Syndrome. | <b>Turner Syndrome</b> (Bicuspid AV); Williams Syndrome (Supravalvular). | <b>Turner Syndrome</b>; Bicuspid Aortic Valve (70% of cases). |
| **Clinical Presentation** | SEM at LUSB radiating to back; RV lift if severe. | SEM at <b>Right 2nd ICS</b> radiating to neck; LV failure if critical. | <b>BP/Pulse disparity</b> (Upper > Lower); leg pain after exercise. |
| **Murmur** | Systolic Ejection Click; SEM at LUSB. | Systolic ejection click at apex; SEM at <b>right upper sternum</b>. | Short systolic murmur at <b>3rd-4th LSB</b>; systolic/continuous murals over back (collaterals). |
| **X-ray Findings** | Post-stenotic dilatation of PA; RVE. | Prominent ascending aorta; cardiomegaly in severe cases. | <b>3 sign</b> (aorta indentation); <b>E sign</b> (on barium swallow); <b>Rib notching</b>. |
| **Treatment** | <b>Balloon valvuloplasty</b> is first line for mod-severe. | Balloon valvuloplasty; <b>Ross procedure</b> (translocating PV to Aortic position). | Resection and end-to-end anastomosis; surgery at 2-3 years old if possible. |

* <b>Pulmonary Valve Stenosis</b> pathophysiology involves a pressure buildup in the RV leading to <b>RV hypertrophy</b> and potentially right-sided heart failure (hepatomegaly, edema).
* <b>Noonan Syndrome</b> is the most common association for <b>Pulmonary Valve Dysplasia</b>.
* <b>Mild Pulmonary Stenosis</b> is diagnosed when the PV gradient is <b>&lt;30 mmHg</b>.
* <b>Severe Pulmonary Stenosis</b> is diagnosed when the PV gradient is <b>>60 mmHg</b> and may present with <b>cyanosis</b> due to R-L shunting at the atrial level.
* <b>Bicuspid Aortic Valve</b> occurs in 1.5% of adults and carries a risk of <b>aortic dilatation</b>.
* <b>Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis</b> is classically associated with <b>Williams Syndrome</b>.
* <b>Shone Complex</b> consists of <b>Aortic Stenosis, Mitral Stenosis, and Coarctation</b>.
* The <b>Ross procedure</b> for Aortic Stenosis involves removing the patient's <b>pulmonary valve</b> to replace the aortic valve and using a homograft for the pulmonary position.
* <b>Coarctation of the Aorta</b> is most commonly <b>juxtaductal</b> (98%), occurring below the left subclavian artery.
* A blood pressure difference of <b>>20 mmHg</b> between the arms and legs is diagnostic for <b>Coarctation of the Aorta</b>.
* <b>Rib notching</b> in Coarctation is caused by the <b>dilation of intercostal arteries</b> serving as collateral circulation.
* <b>Postcoarctectomy syndrome</b> is a paradoxical hypertension occurring 3-5 days after repair due to rebound sympathetic and RAS activation.
* <b>Postoperative Mesenteric Arteritis</b> is a potential surgical complication of CoA repair presenting with abdominal pain and hypertension.
* In newborns with critical Coarctation, <b>Prostaglandin</b> is given to keep the ductus arteriosus open and maintain lower body perfusion.
* The <b>most common cause of death</b> in unrepaired Coarctation is <b>Congestive Heart Failure (26%)</b>, followed by aortic rupture and intracranial hemorrhage.

### Key Differentiations for Exams

* <b>ASD vs. VSD Heart Enlargement</b>: Atrial Septal Defect primarily causes <b>Right</b> heart enlargement (RAE, RVE), while Ventricular Septal Defect primarily causes <b>Left</b> heart enlargement (LAE, LVE).
* <b>ASD vs. PS Murmur</b>: Both have a Systolic Ejection Murmur at the LUSB, but <b>ASD</b> is characterized by a <b>fixed split S2</b>, whereas <b>Pulmonary Stenosis</b> typically has a <b>split S2 that varies</b> and may have an ejection click.
* <b>Murmur Location</b>: Aortic Stenosis is loudest at the <b>Right Upper Sternal Border</b>; Pulmonary Stenosis and ASD are loudest at the <b>Left Upper Sternal Border</b>; VSD is loudest at the <b>Left Lower Sternal Border</b>.
* <b>Murmur Quality</b>: PDA has a <b>continuous machinery-like</b> murmur; VSD has a <b>pansystolic/holosystolic</b> murmur; AS and PS have <b>crescendo-decrescendo ejection</b> murmurs.
* <b>Axis on ECG</b>: <b>AVSD</b> is unique among left-to-right shunts for having <b>Left Axis Deviation (LAD)</b> or Extreme Axis Deviation; Contrast this with <b>ASD</b>, which presents with <b>Right Axis Deviation (RAD)</b>.
* <b>Down Syndrome vs. Turner Syndrome</b>: Down Syndrome is linked to <b>AVSD</b>; Turner Syndrome is linked to <b>Coarctation of the Aorta</b> and <b>Bicuspid Aortic Valve</b>.
* <b>Cyanosis Check</b>: <b>Central cyanosis</b> (tongue/mucosa) suggests CHD; <b>Peripheral cyanosis</b> (lips/extremities) may just be cold or anemia.
* <b>Obstructive vs. Shunt X-ray</b>: Shunt lesions (VSD, ASD, PDA) show <b>increased pulmonary vascular markings</b> (congested lungs); obstructive lesions (PS, AS) often show <b>normal or decreased markings</b> unless heart failure occurs.
* <b>VSD Shunt Timing</b>: In VSD, the shunt occurs during <b>systole</b>; in PDA, the shunt occurs during <b>both systole and diastole</b>.
* <b>VSD Chamber Spare</b>: In VSD, the <b>Right Ventricle (RV) does not enlarge</b> because the shunted blood is ejected directly into the pulmonary artery during contraction.
* <b>CoA Blood Pressure</b>: If Coarctation is <b>between</b> the 2nd (LCC) and 3rd (LS) aortic branches, the <b>left arm</b> will be <b>hypotensive</b> while the <b>right arm</b> is <b>hypertensive</b>.
* <b>Supracristal VSD</b>: Unique among VSDs because it is highly associated with <b>Aortic Valve Prolapse and Regurgitation</b>.
* <b>PDA in Preterm vs. Term</b>: PDA in <b>preterm</b> infants is due to <b>physiological immaturity</b>; PDA in <b>term</b> infants is usually due to a <b>structural deficiency</b> in the ductal wall (lacks mucoid endothehal layer).
* <b>ASD Prevalence</b>: <b>Ostium secundum</b> is the most common ASD; <b>Ostium primum</b> is the one associated with AV valve defects.
* <b>Cyanotic Increased vs. Decreased Flow</b>: <b>TOF</b> has decreased pulmonary flow (clearer lungs on X-ray); <b>TGA and TAPVR</b> have increased pulmonary flow (congested "dirty" lungs on X-ray).
* <b>Medical vs. Surgical Timing</b>: <b>ASD</b> is often detected later (3rd decade); <b>AVSD</b> and <b>Large VSD</b> cause failure early in infancy and require <b>early surgical intervention</b>.

### I. RHEUMATIC FEVER (RF) AND RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE (RHD)

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | An inflammatory, delayed autoimmune response occurring in susceptible individuals following a Group A B-hemolytic Strep (GABHS) infection. |
| **Epidemiology** | **Rheumatic Heart Disease** is the most common acquired heart disease in children and adults worldwide and specifically in the Philippines. |
| **Pathogenesis** | Autoimmune/hypersensitivity reaction where autoantibodies against **M-protein** (strains M1, 3, 5, 6, 18) of GABHS cross-react with cardiac tissues. |
| **Target Organs** | Connective tissues of the heart (carditis), large joints (arthritis), skin (erythema marginatum), brain (chorea), and subcutaneous tissue. |
| **ARF vs. RHD** | **Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)** is the initial inflammatory attack. **Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)** is the chronic sequela characterized by permanent valvular damage (thickened valves). |

* **Strep vs. Viral Pharyngitis Differentiators:**
    * **Strep Pharyngitis:** Abrupt onset, age 5-15 years, poor appetite, <b>absent</b> cough/colds, beefy red granular pharynx with exudates, and tender submandibular adenopathy.
    * **Viral Pharyngitis:** Gradual onset, all ages, retained appetite, <b>present</b> cough/colds, boggy ulcers/vesicles, and non-tender lymph nodes.
* **Primary Prevention of RF:** Treats the initial GABHS infection to prevent RF. **Benzathine Penicillin G** (IM once) or **Penicillin V** (Oral for 10 days) are the Drugs of Choice (DOC).
* **Treatment for Penicillin-Allergic Patients (RF Primary Prevention):** Use Erythromycin, Clindamycin, or Azithromycin for a full course (10 days for most).
* **Jones Criteria (Establish initial ARF attack):** Diagnosis requires 2 Major criteria OR 1 Major + 2 Minor criteria, PLUS evidence of preceding Strep infection (except in Chorea or Indolent Carditis).
* **Jones Criteria - Major Manifestations (High-Risk/PH Population):**
    * **Polyarthritis:** The <b>most common</b> manifesting symptom (75%). Affects large joints, is asymmetric and polymigratory, and responds dramatically to Aspirin within 48-72 hours.
    * **Carditis:** The <b>most serious</b> manifestation causing permanent damage (40-50%). Can present as valvulitis (murmur), myocarditis (cardiomegaly), or pericarditis (friction rub).
    * **Subclinical Carditis:** Valvular dysfunction not heard on auscultation but detected via Echocardiography/Doppler.
    * **Sydenham’s Chorea:** Involuntarily movements ("dancing"), muscular weakness, and emotional disturbance. More common in prepubertal girls; has a long latent period (1-6 months).
    * **Erythema Marginatum:** Rare (<10%). Non-pruritic, pink, serpiginous/ring-like rashes on the trunk; evanescent (disappears in cold, reappears with heat).
    * **Subcutaneous Nodules:** Small, firm, painless nodules over bony prominences/extensor surfaces (knees, elbows, spine).
* **Jones Criteria - Minor Manifestations:** Includes Fever, Arthralgia (joint pain without inflammation), elevated acute phase reactants (ESR/CRP), and prolonged PR interval on ECG.
* **Evidence of Antecedent GABHS:** **ASO Titer** (Elevated ≥330 Todds in children; ≥250 in adults), Positive Throat Culture (found in 25%), or Anti-DNase B test.
* **Secondary Prophylaxis (Prevention of Recurrence):**
    * **Benzathine Penicillin G (IM):** Injected every 21 days (most effective method).
    * **Oral Penicillin V:** Taken twice daily every day.
    * **Erythromycin:** Reserved for those allergic to penicillin/sulfadiazine.
* **Duration of Secondary Prophylaxis:** 
    * **RF with Carditis AND Persistent Valvular Disease:** At least 10 years since last episode or until age 40 (sometimes lifelong).
    * **RF with Carditis but NO Valvular Disease:** 10 years or until adulthood (whichever is longer).
    * **RF WITHOUT Carditis:** 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer).
* **Anti-inflammatory Management:** **Aspirin** (high dose 90-100 mkd) is used for arthritis and mild/moderate carditis. **Prednisone** (2 mkd) is reserved for severe carditis or CHF.
* **Bed Rest Guidelines:** 1-2 weeks for arthritis; 3-4 weeks for mild carditis; 4-6 weeks for moderate carditis; and as long as CHF is present for severe carditis.

#### Valvular Lesions in RHD
* **Mitral Regurgitation (MR):** The <b>most common</b> RHD lesion. Presents with an apical holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla; CXR shows LAE and LVH.
* **Mitral Stenosis (MS):** Becomes more common with increasing age. Presents with a loud S1 and an apical diastolic rumble; associated with high mortality.
* **Aortic Regurgitation (AR):** Presents with a basal diastolic blow, wide pulse pressure (Corrigan's pulse), and a <b>"swan-like"</b> heart appearance on CXR.

### II. KAWASAKI DISEASE (KD)

| Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A self-limiting, febrile mucocutaneous vasculitis of childhood affecting small and medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronaries. |
| **Epidemiology** | 80% of cases occur in children <b><5 years old</b>. Male predominance (1.5:1). Rare in infants <4 months due to maternal antibodies. |
| **Etiology** | Unknown, but hypothesized to be infectious (seasonal/clusters) or a superantigen-driven immune response. |
| **Pathophysiology** | Characterized by vascular endothelial swelling, neutrophil/lymphocyte activation, and eventual fibrosis/stenosis of coronary arteries. |

* **5 Major Clinical Findings (Typical KD):**
    1. **Extremity changes:** Edema/erythema of palms and soles (acute); periungual desquamation (subacute).
    2. **Polymorphous exanthem:** Varied skin rash (not vesicular/bullous), often starting in the perineal/groin area.
    3. **Oropharyngeal changes:** Red/cracked/bleeding lips, strawberry tongue, and pharyngeal erythema.
    4. **Bulbar Conjunctivitis:** Non-exudative (dry), bilateral redness with limbic sparing.
    5. **Cervical Lymphadenopathy:** Usually unilateral, non-suppurative, and >1.5 cm.
* **Diagnostic Guideline:** Fever for ≥5 days <b>AND</b> at least 4 out of the 5 major clinical features.
* **Atypical/Incomplete Kawasaki Disease:** Diagnosed when a patient has fever >5 days but only 2-3 major criteria, supported by elevated CRP/ESR and positive supplemental labs or 2D Echo.
* **Clinical Phases of KD:**
    * **Acute (0-1.5 weeks):** High fever, conjunctivitis, rash, myocarditis.
    * **Subacute (2-6 weeks):** Resolution of fever, **desquamation** (glove-like), and highest risk of **coronary artery aneurysms**.
    * **Convalescent (>6 weeks):** Resolution of clinical signs until ESR normalizes.
* **Cardiac Imaging Schedule:** Echocardiogram should be performed: 1) At diagnosis, 2) At 2 weeks, and 3) At 6-8 weeks.
* **Coronary Artery Aneurysm Classification:** Small (<5 mm), Medium (5-8 mm), and Giant (>8 mm).
* **Risk Factors for Aneurysms (Harada Score):** Male sex, age <12 months, fever >10 days, WBC >12,000, Platelets <350,000, Hematocrit <35%, Albumin <3.5 g/dL, and CRP >3+.
* **Management Goals:** Reduce coronary artery inflammation and prevent thrombosis.
* **Acute Phase Treatment:** **IVIG (2 g/kg)** single infusion PLUS **High-dose Aspirin (80-100 mkd)**. This must be initiated within 10 days of fever onset to prevent aneurysms.
* **Post-Acute Phase Treatment:** Switch to **Low-dose Aspirin (3-5 mkd)** for anti-thrombotic effect once fever is controlled (usually until day 14 or 6-8 weeks).
* **Vaccination Precautions:** Defer Measles and Varicella (live) vaccines for <b>11 months</b> after IVIG administration.
* **Influenza Vaccine:** Mandatory for children on long-term Aspirin therapy to prevent Reye’s Syndrome.

### III. INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE)

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Microbial infection of the endocardial surface, valves, or foreign cardiac devices. |
| **Pathogenesis** | Endothelial damage → Fibrin-platelet deposition (NBTE) → Bacterial adherence/proliferation → Protected vegetation. |

* **High-Risk Conditions for IE:** Prosthetic valves, previous IE, complex cyanotic CHD (TOF, TGA), surgically constructed shunts, and IV drug use.
* **Moderate-Risk Conditions for IE:** PDA, VSD, Bicuspid aortic valve, Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation, and RHD.
* **Acyanotic CHD Note:** Simple acyanotic lesions (like Secundum ASD) are generally <b>not</b> at risk for IE unless repaired with prosthetic material or if residual defects exist.
* **Vascular/Immunologic Phenomena (Classic IE Signs):**
    * **Osler Nodes:** Small, <b>painful</b> nodules on finger/toe pads.
    * **Janeway Lesions:** Hemorrhagic, <b>painless</b> macules on palms/soles.

        2. Evidence of endocardial involvement on Echogram (vegetation, abscess, or new valvular regurgitation).
    * **Minor Criteria:** Predisposition (heart condition/IV drug use), Fever ≥38°C, Vascular phenomena, Immunologic phenomena, and Microbiological evidence (atypical cultures).
* **Diagnosis Interpretation:** Definitive IE requires 2 Major criteria OR 1 Major + 3 Minor OR 5 Minor.
* **IE Prophylaxis for Dental Procedures:** Only recommended for high-risk patients (Prosthetic valves, unrepaired cyanotic CHD, repaired CHD with prosthetic material for 6 months).
* **Antibiotic Prophylaxis DOC:** **Amoxicillin** (50 mg/kg) orally 30-60 minutes before the procedure; use Clindamycin or Cephalexin if allergic to Penicillin.

| **Skin Signs** | Erythema Marginatum (Serpiginous) | Polymorphous rash / Desquamation | Janeway lesions / Osler nodes |
| **Pathognomonic Site**| Heart valves (Endocardium) | Coronary Arteries (Vasculitis) | Vegetations on Valves/Devices |
| **Diagnostic Tool** | Jones Criteria + ASO Titer | Fever + 4/5 clinical criteria | Duke Criteria + Blood Culture |
| **Aspirin Use** | High dose for Anti-inflammatory | High (Acute) then Low (Subacute) | Not indicated (use Antibiotics) |
| **Most Common Valve**| Mitral Valve (MR) | N/A (Mainly Coronary Arteries) | Varies (Native or Prosthetic) |
| **Age Group** | 5 - 14 years old | < 5 years (80% of cases) | Any age (with risk factors) |
| **Joint Involvement** | Polymigratory Arthritis (Large joints) | Arthritis can occur (not a major criteria) | Rare/Non-specific |
| **Treatment DOC**| Penicillin (Secondary Prophylaxis) | IVIG + Aspirin | Long-term IV Antibiotics |

* **Joint Pain Distinction:** In **RF**, Arthritis is **Major** (swelling/redness) and Polymigratory, while Arthralgia is **Minor** (pain only).
* **Skin Lesion Distinction:** **Janeway lesions** (IE) are painless and flat; **Osler nodes** (IE) are painful and raised; **Erythema Marginatum** (RF) is ring-shaped and non-pruritic.
* **Strep Infection Timeline:** RF occurs **10-14 days** after strep throat; IE is an active infection.
* **CHD Risk Distinction:** **Cyanotic CHD** are high risk for IE; **Acyanotic CHD** (like Secundum ASD) are considered low/no risk for IE by the lecturer.
* **Desquamation Distinction:** KD desquamation is <b>glove-like</b> and occurs in the <b>subacute phase</b> (2-6 weeks).
* **ASO Titer Importance:** High ASO titer establishes preceding Strep infection for RF but is NOT used for KD or IE diagnosis.
* **Vaccination Delay:** Specifically associated with **Kawasaki Disease** (defer live vaccines for 11 months due to IVIG).
* **Aspirin Response:** RF arthritis responds dramatically within 2-3 days; KD fever responds/resolves within 1-2 days of IVIG.

### Tetraology of Fallot (TOF)
- <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</b> consists of four components: Pulmonary/RVOT stenosis, malaligned VSD, Overriding Aorta, and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH).
- The severity of <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</b> depends on the degree of RVOT stenosis, not the VSD size.
- A <b style="color:red;">"Pink TOF"</b> occurs when RVOT stenosis is mild, causing a Left-to-Right shunt and heart failure symptoms.
- Patients with <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</b> assume a <b style="color:red;">squatting position</b> to increase Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR), which reduces right-to-left shunting and improves oxygenation.
- A <b style="color:red;">Paroxysmal Hypercyanotic attack (Tet spell)</b> is characterized by hyperpnea, restlessness, worsening cyanosis, and the temporary disappearance of the murmur.
- Chronic hypoxemia in <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</b> leads to <b style="color:red;">Polycythemia</b> and clubbing of the fingers.
- The CXR of <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</b> shows a concave Main Pulmonary Artery and an uplifted apex.
- <b style="color:red;">Di George Syndrome (CATCH 22)</b> is an associated anomaly of TOF involving chromosome 22q11 deletion.
- Acute management of a <b style="color:red;">Tet spell</b> includes knee-chest position, oxygen, morphine, sodium bicarbonate, and <b style="color:red;">Propranolol</b>.
- The <b style="color:red;">Blalock-Taussig Shunt (BTS)</b> is a temporary surgical procedure creating a connection like an artificial PDA to stimulate pulmonary artery growth.

### Tricuspid Valve Atresia (TVA)
- <b style="color:red;">Tricuspid Valve Atresia (TVA)</b> is the only cyanotic CHD that typically presents with Left Axis Deviation (LAD) and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH).
- Survival in <b style="color:red;">Tricuspid Valve Atresia (TVA)</b> is dependent on an ASD to allow blood to flow from the RA to the LA.
- <b style="color:red;">TVA Type I</b> involves normally related great arteries, while <b style="color:red;">TVA Type II</b> involves Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).
- The <b style="color:red;">Bidirectional Glenn Shunt</b> involves anastomosing the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) to the pulmonary arteries at 3-6 months of age.
- The <b style="color:red;">Modified Fontan Procedure</b> involves anastomosing the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) to the pulmonary arteries at 3 years of age.
- <b style="color:red;">Rashkind atrial balloon septostomy (BAS)</b> is used to enlarge a small ASD to improve mixing in TVA.

### Ebstein Anomaly
- <b style="color:red;">Ebstein Anomaly</b> involves the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve, leading to a small, functional right ventricle and a massive right atrium.
- <b style="color:red;">Functional Pulmonary Atresia</b> occurs in Ebstein Anomaly because the RV is too small to pump blood effectively to the lungs.
- Cardiac screening is essential for <b style="color:red;">Ebstein Anomaly</b> because RA enlargement can stretch the SA node, causing life-threatening arrhythmias like <b style="color:red;">SVT</b>.

</table>

### D-Transposition of the Great Arteries (D-TGA)
- <b style="color:red;">D-TGA</b> is common in infants of mothers with <b style="color:red;">Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)</b>.
- In <b style="color:red;">D-TGA</b>, the aorta arises from the RV and the pulmonary artery from the LV, creating independent parallel circulations. 
- Clinical signs of <b style="color:red;">D-TGA</b> include severe cyanosis in the first hours of life, tachypnea, and a single, loud S2; murmurs are often absent.
- The <b style="color:red;">Arterial Switch Operation (Jatene)</b> is the definitive surgical treatment, typically performed within the first 2 weeks of life.

### Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR)
- <b style="color:red;">TAPVR</b> is characterized by pulmonary veins draining into systemic venous channels instead of the Left Atrium.
- The <b style="color:red;">Supracardiac type</b> is the most common form (50%) of TAPVR, where pulmonary veins drain into the SVC.
- <b style="color:red;">Snowman sign</b> (or Figure-of-8) on CXR is associated with supracardiac TAPVR due to an enlarged SVC and persistent left vertical vein.

### Truncus Arteriosus
- <b style="color:red;">Truncus Arteriosus</b> features a single arterial trunk arising from the heart, always associated with a VSD.
- Infants with <b style="color:red;">Truncus Arteriosus</b> develop heart failure by 1-2 months of age, presenting with bounding pulses and wide pulse pressure.

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- <b style="color:red;">Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)</b> is the most common pediatric cardiomyopathy, often idiopathic or following viral myocarditis. 
- Pathogenesis of <b style="color:red;">Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)</b> involve myocyte loss (apoptosis) and extracellular matrix remodeling.
- <b style="color:red;">ACE inhibitors and Beta-blockers</b> are used in DCM to retard or reverse maladaptive ventricular remodeling.
- Physical findings in <b style="color:red;">Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)</b> include a displaced apical impulse, S3/S4 gallop, and a murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- <b style="color:red;">Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)</b> is often caused by mutations in <b style="color:red;">cardiac β-myosin heavy-chain (MYH7)</b> or myosin-binding protein C.
- Histopathology of <b style="color:red;">Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)</b> shows myocytes arranged in a <b style="color:red;">chaotic, disorganized fashion</b>.
- Patients with <b style="color:red;">Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)</b> may have a double/triple apical impulse and a systolic ejection murmur that increases with LV outflow obstruction.
- Competitive sports are <b style="color:red;">prohibited</b> for patients diagnosed with HCM due to the risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM)
- <b style="color:red;">Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM)</b> is characterized by normal ventricular size but <b style="color:red;">massive biatrial enlargement</b>.
- Cardiac catheterization in <b style="color:red;">Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM)</b> reveals an early diastolic dip and plateau pattern known as the <b style="color:red;">Square root sign</b>.

### Myocarditis
- <b style="color:red;">Viral infection</b> is the most common cause of myocarditis (e.g., COVID-19, Dengue).
- <b style="color:red;">Milrinone</b> is an inotrope used in myocarditis that also helps decrease pulmonary artery pressure, but it should not be given if the patient is hypotensive.
- <b style="color:red;">Endomyocardial biopsy</b> is the diagnostic gold standard for myocarditis, showing inflammatory infiltrates and myocyte necrosis.

<h2 style="color:red;">IV. DISEASES OF THE PERICARDIUM</h2>

### Acute Pericarditis and Tamponade
- <b style="color:red;">Acute Pericarditis</b> presents with sharp chest pain that is relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward.
- <b style="color:red;">Pulsus paradoxus</b> is an excessive fall of systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mm Hg) during inspiration, indicating cardiac tamponade.
- <b style="color:red;">Beck’s Triad</b> for cardiac tamponade consists of: 1) Hypotension, 2) Jugular Venous Distension (Kussmaul's sign), and 3) Distant/Muffled heart sounds.
- CXR findings for massive pericardial effusion include the <b style="color:red;">Water bottle sign</b> or Erlenmeyer flask appearance.

### Constrictive Pericarditis
- <b style="color:red;">Constrictive Pericarditis</b> involves fibrosis and calcification of the pericardium, leading to impaired diastolic filling.
- A <b style="color:red;">Pericardial knock</b> is a characteristic clinical finding in constrictive pericarditis.
- <b style="color:red;">Pericardiectomy</b> (surgical removal of the pericardium) is the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis.

<h2 style="color:red;">V. KEY DIFFERENTIATORS AND COMPARISONS</h2>

- <b style="color:red;">Boot-shaped heart</b> (TOF) vs. <b style="color:red;">Egg-on-a-string</b> (TGA) vs. <b style="color:red;">Snowman sign</b> (TAPVR) vs. <b style="color:red;">Box-shaped heart</b> (Ebstein).
- <b style="color:red;">Tetralogy of Fallot</b> vs. <b style="color:red;">Tricuspid Atresia</b> ECG: TOF has Right Axis Deviation/RVH; TVA has <b style="color:red;">Left Axis Deviation/LVH</b>.
- <b style="color:red;">Tet spell</b> disappearance of murmur: Due to a sudden increase in RVOT obstruction, reducing the flow across the pulmonary valve.
- <b style="color:red;">Squatting in TOF</b> vs. <b style="color:red;">Knee-chest position</b>: Both aim to increase <b style="color:red;">Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)</b> to force blood through the lungs.
